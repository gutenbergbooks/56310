<h3>
THE UNDERCURRENT
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Those whom God has joined together let
no man put asunder."  It seemed to the
bride that the Rev. George Prentiss laid
especially solemn stress on these words, and as she
listened to the announcement that, forasmuch as
Emil Stuart and Constance Forbes had consented
together in holy matrimony, he pronounced them
to be man and wife, her nerves quivered with
satisfaction at the thought that she was Emil's
forever.  The deed was done, and she was joyous that
the doubt which had harassed her in her weak
moments&mdash;whether she was ready to renounce her
ambition to help in the great work of education for
the sake of any man&mdash;was solved and merged in
the ocean of their love.  Doubtless Emil was not
perfect, but she adored him.  No one had even
hinted that he was not perfect, but she had made up
her mind not to be ridiculous in her rapture, and
to look the probable truth squarely in the face as
became an intelligent woman.  She knew that
until recently he had been only a clerk with Toler
&amp; Company, lumber merchants, and that he had
just started in business on his own account.  He
was dependent for support on his individual
labors, but she had in her own name the nice little
nest-egg of five thousand dollars, realized from
the sale of the family homestead at Colton, the
country town, ten miles distant, from which, an
orphan, she had come to Benham a year previous.
She was marrying for love a young man who had
his own way to make, just as hundreds of others
were doing every day, and she was proud of her
part in the compact.  A great happiness had come
into her life, almost against her will, but now
that it had come she recognized that it was nature
working in the ordinary way, and that she would
not remain single for all the kindergartens in
creation.  She had known Emil only a year; still that
year had been one of courtship, and no one had
ever spoken ill of him, though she had been told
that Mr. Prentiss, as a rector charged with
overseeing the destinies of friendless girls who were
members of his parish, had made inquiries.
Moreover, Mr. Prentiss had agreed that two
young people, situated as they were, whose hearts
were united, did well to marry on a small income
and trust somewhat to the future.  How otherwise,
as he sagely remarked, was ideal love to
flourish, and were mercenary considerations to be
kept at bay?  Emil was twenty-five, and she just
twenty.  Youthful, but still of a proper age, and
they were growing older every day.  Decidedly it
was a prudent love-match, and she had a right to
be joyful, for there was nothing to reproach
herself with or to regret.
</p>

<p>
It will thus be observed that Constance Forbes
was no happy-go-lucky sort of girl, and that
though she was marrying younger than she had
expected, she was marrying with her eyes open.
She had scrutinized severely the romantic episode
which had made her and her lover acquainted,
and had even refused him the first time he asked
her in order to counterbalance the glamour resulting
from that meeting.  The episode was a sequel
to an accident to the train on which she was
travelling from Colton to Benham.  The engine ran
into the rear of some freight cars, owing to a
misplaced switch, and the tracks were strewed
with splintered merchandise, so that the train was
delayed four hours.  The natural thing for
passengers with time to kill was to inspect the
wreckage, which, besides the dilapidated railroad
apparatus, consisted of mangled chairs and tables, and
bursted bags of grain, a medley of freight
impressive in its disorder.  Constance found herself
presently discussing with a young man the injuries
to the cow-catcher of the engine, which had been
twisted ludicrously awry.  A moment before two
other persons, one of them a woman, had been on
the spot, and the conversation had been innocuously
general, but they had drifted off.  Constance
was conscious of having noticed the young
man in her car, and of having casually observed
that he had an alert expression, and that his hair
rose perpendicularly from his brow, suggesting
the assertiveness of a king-bird.  To allow a
young man to scrape acquaintance with her in cold
blood would ordinarily have been entirely repugnant
to her ideas of maidenly propriety, but she
resisted her first impulse to turn her back on him
and abruptly close the interview as needlessly
harsh.  It would surely be prudish to abstain from
examining the battered locomotive, which lay on
one side, with its nose in the air, as though it had
fallen in the act of rearing, merely because a
respectable-looking male passenger happened to be
equally interested in the results of the catastrophe.
So it chanced that after they had exchanged
observations concerning the injuries to the overthrown
"Vulcan" and speculated as to how long they were
likely to be delayed, their conversation became
less impersonal.  That is, the young man
informed her that he was in the employ of Toler &amp;
Company, lumber merchants, and was returning
to Benham after having made some collections for
them in the neighboring country.  Then he was
familiar with Benham?  Familiar?  He should
say so.  He had been settled there for three years,
and&mdash;(so he gave Constance to understand)&mdash;there
was absolutely nothing regarding the place
which he could not tell her.  First of all, Benham
was a growing, thriving city.  Its population had
quadrupled in fifteen years.  Think of that!  So
that now (in 1886) there were upward of three
hundred and fifty thousand souls in the city's
limits.  It was a hustling place.  A shrewd,
energetic man, who kept his wits active, ought to make
his fortune there in ten years, if he were given a
proper chance.  Was she going to live in Benham?
</p>

<p>
Constance admitted that she was, and, helped
along by friendly inquiries, she told him briefly
her story.  That she had lost her father and
mother within a few months of each other, and
that she had decided to come to Benham, of
which, of course, she had heard as a progressive
city, in order to learn the kindergarten methods
of teaching.  Subsequently she hoped to obtain an
appointment as a school-teacher, and so earn her
own living.
</p>

<p>
"When you've finished your lessons and are
ready to teach, let me know.  I may be able to
help you.  I'm a little in politics myself, and a
word to the school committee from a free and
independent constituent might get you a place."
</p>

<p>
He spoke jauntily though respectfully; but the
offer reminded Constance that the conversation
was taking a more intimate turn than she had
bargained for.  She thanked him, and began to
move slowly away, not with any definite idea of
direction, but as a maidenly interruption.
Mr. Stuart&mdash;for he had told her his name&mdash;kept pace
with her and seemed quite unconscious of her
purpose.  In the few minutes during which they had
been chatting she had observed that he was
somewhat above the average height and rather spare,
with a short mustache which curled up at the ends
and was becoming.  Also, that he had small, dark
eyes, which he moved rapidly and which gave him,
in conjunction with his rising brow and hair, a
restless, nervous expression.
</p>

<p>
As they walked along the track the conductor
was coming toward them.  He had been to the
telegraph office and was returning with a
telegram in his hands.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what are our chances of getting away
from here?" Emil asked, with the manner of a
man to whom time is precious.
</p>

<p>
"It'll be a good three hours before the wrecking
train arrives and the road is clear."
</p>

<p>
The youth and the maid looked at each other
and laughed at the gloominess of the situation.
</p>

<p>
"In that case," said Constance, glancing at the
sloping banks bordering the railroad tracks, which
were bright with white weed and other flora of
the early summer time, "we shall have to dine on
wild flowers."
</p>

<p>
"I have some chocolate in my bag."
</p>

<p>
Constance flushed slightly with embarrassment.
Her random remark seemed almost to amount to
a premeditated invitation to share his resources.
</p>

<p>
Emil's gaze had followed hers in her allusion
to the wild flowers.  "I'll tell you what," he
exclaimed, impulsively, "since we have three hours
to wait, why shouldn't we escape from this culvert
and see what there is to be seen from the top of
the bank?  I shall be able to show you Benham,"
he added, noticing, perhaps, that she looked
doubtful, "for we are only nine or ten miles
away."
</p>

<p>
This was tempting.  Besides it would surely be
ridiculous to remain where she was rather than
explore the country merely because he was a casual
acquaintance and had some chocolate in his
travelling bag.  The circumstances were harmless and
unavoidable, unless she wished to write herself
down a prude.  The result was the logic of
common-sense prevailed, and Constance gave her
consent to the proposal.  So they climbed the bank
presently, pausing on the way to gather some
posies, with which the party of the second part
proceeded to adorn her hat, after they had
established themselves on an eligible fallen tree
commanding a pleasing view.  The fallen tree was at
the edge of a copse of pine wood some two
hundred yards from the bank.  Thus they were
sheltered from the sun.  Out of the copse, almost at
their feet, ran a bubbling brook, which added a
touch of romance to the landscape rolling away in
undulating and occasionally wooded farming
land, as far as the eye could reach, until it
terminated in a stretch of steeples and towers
surmounted by a murky cloud.  There was Benham.
</p>

<p>
Although they were too distant to discern more
than a confused panorama, Emil essayed a few
topographical details.  He explained that twenty-five
years earlier Benham had comprised merely a
cluster of frame houses in the valley of the peaceful
river Nye, which still served as an aid to
description.  Primarily a village on the south side
of the stream, it had first developed in a southerly
direction, spreading like a bursting seed also
laterally to east and west.  Its original main street,
once bordered by old-fashioned frame houses
with grass-plots and shade trees, had evolved into
Central Avenue, at first the desirable street for
residences, but now, and considerably prior to his
advent, the leading retail shopping artery, alive
with dry-goods shops, into which the women
swarmed like flies.  To the west of Central
Avenue lay the tide of social fashion culminating
two miles distant in the River Drive, a wide
avenue of stately private houses, situated where
the Nye made a broad bend to the north, and the
new district beyond the river, where the mansion
of Carleton Howard, the railroad magnate, stood
a pioneer among Elysian fields of real estate
enterprise, sanctified by immaculate road surfaces and
liberal electric light.
</p>

<p>
Constance listened eagerly.  She was interested
to know particulars concerning the city where she
was to live, and she enjoyed the lively sardonic
touches which relieved his description.  Though
possessing an essentially earnest soul, she was
susceptible to humor, and had an aversion for lack of
appreciation of true conditions.
</p>

<p>
To the east of Central Avenue, Stuart further
explained, lay first the shops and the business
centre, and then the polyglot army of citizens who
worked in the mills, oil yards, and pork factories.
Across the river to the south, approached by seven
bridges of iron, replacing two frail wooden
bridges of former days, were the mills and other
industrial establishments.  Beyond these still
further to the north was Poland, so called, a
settlement of the Poles, favorite resort of the young
ladies of Benham's first families eager to offer the
benefits of religion and civilization to the ignorant
poor.  Following the Nye in its sweep to the
north, until it deflected again to the east, so as to
run almost parallel to its first course, but in the
opposite direction, were the public park, the land
bonded for an Art Museum, Wetmore College
(the Woman's Academy of learning), and the
other more or less ornamental institutions.  This
region of embryo public buildings, garnished with
august spaces, was a sort of boundary line on the
north, turning the current of industrial population
more to the east.  Just as the tide to the west of
Central Avenue was one of increasing comfort and
fashion, this to the southeast, stretching out as
the city spread, and forced constantly forward by
the encroachments of trade, was one of common
workaday conditions, punctuated (as he phrased
it) now and again by poverty and distress.
</p>

<p>
"I tell you, Miss&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Forbes, Constance Forbes is my name."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you.  I tell you, Miss Forbes, Benham
is a wideawake city.  We have all the modern
improvements.  But the rich man gets the cream
every time.  I heard millionaire Carleton Howard,
the railroad magnate, say the other day from
the platform, that there is no country in the world
where the poor man is so well off as in this.  Yet
it's equally true that the rich are all the time
getting richer and the poor poorer.  He neglected to
state that."  He laughed scornfully, and his eyes
sought Constance's face for approval.  She knew
little concerning millionaires or the truth of the
proposition he was advancing, but it interested her
to perceive that he was evidently on the side of
the unfortunate, for she cherished a keen pity for
the ignorant poor almost as a heritage.  Her
father had been a country physician&mdash;an energetic,
sympathetic man, whose large vitality had
been spent in relieving the sufferings of a clientage
of small tillers of the soil over an area of fifteen
miles.  He had often spoken to her with pathos
of the patient struggles of the common people.
Her own susceptibility to human suffering had
been early quickened by the destiny of her mother,
who had been thrown from a sleigh shortly after
Constance's birth, and had remained a paralytic
invalid to the day of her death, requiring incessant
care.
</p>

<p>
"When I run for Congress," he resumed, scowling
slightly as he fixed his gaze on the murky
cloud surmounting Benham, "it'll be on a platform
advocating government ownership of railroads,
telegraphs, water-works, electric street cars, and
all the other fat things out of which our modern
philanthropists with capital squeeze enormous
profits at the expense of their fellow-citizens.  I'm
against all that sort of thing.  Buy a gas plant
to-day and consolidate it with another to-morrow.
Profit to the promoter two hundred per cent.,
without leaving the office.  What does the
consumer get?  Cheaper gas and greater efficiency.
That's the fine-sounding tag; and some of the
horny-handed multitude are guileless enough to
believe it.  It won't be long though now before
I make my own pile," he added, not quite
relevantly.  "I'd have made it before this if they
hadn't hindered me."
</p>

<p>
Constance perceived that he expected her to
inquire what this meant, and she was curious to
know.  So she asked.
</p>

<p>
"My employers, Toler &amp; Company.  If I had
had the capital and the opportunities of those
people, I should be wearing diamonds.  I've tried
to point out to them more than once that they
were throwing big chances away by being so
conservative and old-fashioned in their methods
instead of branching out boldly and making a ten
strike.  One thing is certain, I'm not going to
invent ideas for them for a pitiful one thousand
dollars a year much longer.  If they think they
can afford not to raise my salary and give me a
chance to show what I can do, I'm going to let
them try after January first.  It isn't very
pleasant, Miss Forbes, to be doing most of the work
and see someone else reaping all the profits.  They
can't help making money, old fogies as they are."
</p>

<p>
It was certainly a galling situation.  Constance,
who was young herself, felt that she sympathized
with his desire to compel recognition.
</p>

<p>
"It doesn't seem right at all," she said, "that
you should be kept down."
</p>

<p>
"I've made up my mind to give them notice
that I must have an interest in the business after
the first of the year, or I quit and start on my own
account.  I've my eye on a man with five thousand
dollars who will go into partnership with me I
hope."
</p>

<p>
Constance thought of her own five thousand
dollars.  She would almost like to lend it to him,
though, of course, that was out of the question.
Still, there would be no harm in offering moral
support.  "If I were a man," she said, "and had
faith in my own abilities, I wouldn't remain in a
subordinate position a moment longer than was
really necessary."
</p>

<p>
In response to this note of sympathy Emil
opened his bag and produced two sticks of
chocolate.  He broke them apart and presented one
to his companion.  He also exhibited a
compressible metal drinking-cup, which he filled from
the bubbling brook.  A crow cawed in the pine
copse as though to call attention to the idyl, but
only the two philosophers on the fallen tree-trunk
were within hearing of his note of irony, and they
regarded it merely as an added rural charm.
</p>

<p>
"Would you object to my smoking my pipe?"
</p>

<p>
"Not in the least.  My father was devoted to
his pipe."
</p>

<p>
Another bond of sympathy.  Or at least an
indication to the swain that here was a maiden who
was no spoil-sport and who would not have to be
wooed by the sacrifice of personal comfort.
Moreover, it was not lost on him that she was
an attractive-looking maiden, and that her voice
was well modulated and refined.  Yet he was not
thinking of her, but merely of her sex in general,
when he said, "Besides, I hope to be married some
day.  How could I support a wife in Benham on
one thousand dollars a year in the manner in
which I should wish her to live?"
</p>

<p>
Constance could not answer this question, and
did not try.  It belonged to the category of
remarks which were to be treated by a single woman
as monologues.  But she was keenly interested.
One thousand dollars a year did not seem to her
a very pitiful sum for a young couple just
starting in life.  She had heard her father say that
when he married her mother he had only a
hundred dollars in the world, and no assurance of
practice.  But that was not in Benham.  She had
already divined that Benham was to be a land of
surprises.  At all events she could not help
admiring Mr. Stuart's chivalric attitude toward his
future wife.  His ambition was obviously quickened
by the thought of his future sweetheart, whoever
she might be; which was an agreeable tribute
to her own sex, suggesting susceptibility to
sentiment.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I'd have been married before this if
Toler &amp; Company had not, as you say, kept me
down," he continued, pensively, blowing a ring of
smoke to emphasize his mood.  "When after
working hard all day I go to my room at night
and take up my violin, I often think that if I
could play to the woman I loved, instead of to the
blank wall, how much happier I should be.  But
I suppose some of my friends would declare that
I was a fool to desire a yoke around my neck
before fate placed it there."
</p>

<p>
His own readiness to relieve the stress of his
confession by a sardonic turn counteracted the
constraint which his intimate avowal had aroused.
Incredible as it is that a man in his sober senses
should offer himself to a woman the first time he
beholds her, no woman is altogether unaware that
he is liable to do so.  A modest and thoughtful
young girl shrinks from precipitate progress in
affairs of the heart.  Obviously the ground was
less dangerous than it had for a moment appeared,
but Constance sought the avenue of escape
which his allusion to music offered.  Besides it
pleased her to hear that he was æsthetic in his
interests.
</p>

<p>
"You play on the violin, then?" she asked.  "I
envy anybody who has the talent and the opportunity
for anything of that sort.  I sing a little,
but my voice is uncultivated, for in Colton there
was no one to tell us our faults."  The earnest
gleam in her fine dark eyes seemed to second the
fresh enthusiasm of her tone.
</p>

<p>
The warning scream of the whistle, not the
voice of the crow, broke in at this point on their
preoccupation with each other.  This was the
romantic episode from which their acquaintance
dated&mdash;an episode which might readily have
signified nothing.  But on the other hand, it naturally
supplied to the party of the second part a fair
field of memory in which her imagination might
wander when stirred by the subsequent attentions
of this young knight with sympathy for the
unfortunate, resolute confidence in his own abilities,
generous views in regard to matrimony and a
sensitive, æsthetic soul.  For Emil Stuart sought her
out at once, visited her at her lodgings and gave
unmistakable signs that his purpose was both
honorable and definite.  Within six months she knew
from his own lips that he wished to make her his
wife.  She took another three in which to conquer
her scruples and maidenly disinclination to be won
too easily.  Why should she not yield?  He was
her first lover, and she loved him, and he declared
with fervor that he adored her.  Contact with the
conditions of a large city had shown her unmistakably
that only after years of struggle could she
hope to be more than a mere hand-maiden in the
work of education, and that during the early
period of her employment, if not indeed for life,
the hours of work would be long and confining
and her pleasures few.  Here was a companion
who would provide her with a home, and upon
whom the tenderness of her woman's nature could
be freely bestowed.  It was the old, old story, she
said to herself, but was there a better one?
</p>

<h3>
II
</h3>

<p>
The young couple bought a small house on
the outskirts of the city, some distance
beyond the Nye, where it flows at right angles
with its original course, and in the general region
of fastidious growth, but in a settlement of
inexpensive villas to one side of the trend of fashion.
The bridegroom had not forgotten his liberal
intention to begin housekeeping on a somewhat
more ambitious scale than his salary as a clerk had
warranted.  He was now the senior partner in the
firm of Stuart &amp; Robinson, lumber dealers, which
had been in existence six months.  He had parted
from his employers, Toler &amp; Company, on the
first of January, because of their refusal to accede
to his demands, and had been able to persuade
the comrade with five thousand dollars, to whom
he had referred at his first meeting with
Constance to enter into a business alliance.
Robinson was three years his junior, and without
commercial experience, but eager to turn the windfall,
which had come to him through the death of an
aunt into a cool million.  What could be more
natural than to take advantage of the experience
which Stuart offered him&mdash;an experience which
gave promise of swift and lucrative operations in
the near future?
</p>

<p>
It was a very modest establishment, from the
standpoint of affluence.  A neat little house of
eight rooms supplied with modern improvements,
and, though one of a builder's batch, designed
with some regard for artistic effect, which
indicated that a preference for harmonious beauty was
working in the popular mind of Benham against
the idols, colorless uniformity and bedizened
ugliness.  To the bride, whose experience of
housekeeping was limited to a country town where
colorless uniformity ruled undisturbed and modern
improvements were unknown, the expenditure of
her nest-egg of five thousand dollars in this
complete little home seemed an investment no less
enchanting than wise.  Five thousand for the house,
with a subsequent mortgage upon it of one
thousand for the purchase of the furniture and to
provide a small bank balance for emergencies.  This
was her contribution to the domestic partnership,
and she rejoiced to think that her ability to help
to this extent would leave Emil a free hand for
the display of his business talent.
</p>

<p>
The basis of a newly married woman's peace of
soul is trust.  She feels that the responsibility is
on her husband to make good the manly qualities
with which she has endowed him, and because of
which she has consented to become his mate.
Occasionally during the first few months of her
married life Constance laughed to think that all her
maidenly eagerness to solve the riddle of life
brilliantly, and all her profound searching of the
mysteries of the universe should have ended in
her becoming an every-day housewife with
dustpan and brush, and the wife of one who, to all
outward appearances, was an every-day young
man.  But her laugh savored of gladness.  She
had given herself to him because she had faith
that his energy, self-reliance, fearless humor and
sympathetic hatred of shams would distinguish
him presently from the common herd of men, and
vindicate her infatuation.  She had given herself
to him, besides, because he loved her&mdash;a delightful
consciousness.  Accordingly, she enclosed herself
in the web of happiness which her confidence
in him had spun about her, and took up her
domestic duties with light-hearted devotion.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, no woman emerges from her
honeymoon with exactly the same estimate of her
lover as before.  If nothing else, she has seen his
mental and moral characteristics in their undress,
so to speak, and become habituated to their
sublimity.  We may be no less fond of a person
whose anecdotes have grown familiar to us, and
analogously a wife does not weary of her husband's
qualities merely because they have lost the
glamor of novelty.  On the contrary she is apt to
continue to adore them because they are his.  Still
she feels free to scrutinize them closely
and&mdash;unconsciously at least&mdash;to submit them to the test
of her own silent judgment.  She discovers, too,
of course, that he has sides and idiosyncrasies the
existence of which she never suspected.  Ordinarily
she finds to her surprise that his attitude
in regard to this or that matter has shifted
perceptibly since marriage, so that, instead of being
lukewarm or ardent, as the case may be, he has
become almost strenuous or indifferent in his
attitude.  Hence she divines that during their
courtship some of his real opinions and tendencies have
been kept in retreat.
</p>

<p>
Constance sensibly had decided in advance that
Emil was not perfect, so she was prepared to
discover a blemish here and there.  In spite of her
happiness it became obvious to her during the first
six months of their married life that the self-confidence
which had attracted her verged at times on
braggadocio, and moreover that opposition or
disappointment made him sour and morose.  If his
affairs were prospering, his spirits rose, his wits
scintillated, and he spoke of the world with a gay,
if sardonic, forbearance, which suggested that it
was soon to be his foot-ball.  But if matters went
wrong, he not only became depressed, but was
prone to dwell upon his own ill-luck, and inveigh
bitterly against the existing conditions of society.
She had noticed from the first days of their
acquaintance that there appeared to be an
inconsistency between his eagerness to grow rich and
his enmity toward the capitalists of Benham; but
she had gathered that he was merely eager to put
himself in a position where his sympathy for the
toiling mass could be fortified by the opportunities
which wealth would afford.  But now that his
feverish absorption in business had apparently
banished all interest in philanthropic undertakings
from his thoughts, the inconsistency was more
conspicuous.
</p>

<p>
Constance spoke to Emil about this at last.
Naturally, she broached the topic when he was in
one of his sanguine moods.  In response he took
out his pocket-book and asked her how much she
required, having jumped to the conclusion that
she was beating around the bush and had some
particular object of charity in view.
</p>

<p>
"You don't understand, exactly, Emil," she
answered.  "I'm not asking for money; I was merely
hoping that having me to provide for isn't going
to cut you off from your former associations&mdash;to
lessen your sympathy with political movements
for the protection of the people such as you used
to take part in before we were married."
</p>

<p>
Stuart frowned, and thrust his hands deep into
his pockets as he was apt to do when he felt his
oats.  "You don't seem to realize, Constance, that
a man starting in business needs all his energy and
watchfulness to avoid having his head thrust
under water by the fellows who are on the
surface of the commercial whirlpool and who don't
want company.  When I've got the sharks in my
line of trade where I want them, which is,
metaphorically speaking, at the bottom of the pond,
it'll be time enough to take up politics.  You'd
like to see me in Congress some day, wouldn't you?
Well, that will be plain sailing for me in this
district as soon as I control the lumber business of
Benham, little saint."
</p>

<p>
This sounded plausible, and did not seem to
admit of argument, provided the consummation
of the business supremacy indicated by her
husband was not deferred too long.  She dismissed
the matter from her mind for the time being.  It
was less easy to dispose of another tendency which
had revealed itself in unmistakable guise since their
marriage, and this was Emil's indifferent attitude,
not merely toward her form of religious faith, but
toward all religion.  Within a short time after
their acquaintance began she had discovered that
he was not an Episcopalian, and that his views
regarding the spiritual problems of the universe
were not those of orthodox Christians.  But on
the other hand, although he was fond even then
of blowing down her card-houses, as he called
them, with an occasional blast of scientific truth,
he had been ready to accompany her to church
and had never seemed lacking in reverence.  She
had asked herself the question why she should
stifle her love for him merely because his conception
of the eternal mysteries did not coincide with
her own, and she had answered it by the independent
assurance that his attitude toward life was the
important consideration.  She had even been
fascinated by his broad outlook on the universe, with
his flashing eyes and his righteous contempt for
some of the dogmas of the sects.  He had seemed
to her imagination at such times almost as a
reforming archangel purging away the dross of
superstition and convention from the essentials of
religious faith.  He did not believe in the miracles,
it is true, because he regarded them as violations
of the laws of the universe; but was he not a
firm believer in the spirit of Christian conduct?
</p>

<p>
She had reasoned thus as a maiden, and had
never doubted the soundness of her self-justification.
But the sequel was disturbing to her peace
of mind and to her hopes.  It was not Emil's
refusal to go to church, nor his dedication of the
Sabbath to mere rest and recreation which
distressed her, but his scornful tone in regard to any
form of religious ceremonial; his scornful tone
toward her own reverence for the faith in which
she had been educated.  Even the term of endearment
which he coined for her, "little saint," was
a jocose and condescending appellation reflecting
on her susceptibility to ideas which clever people
had discarded as fatuous.  She could have borne
without complaint going to church alone had he
been willing to respect her opinions as she
respected his.  But on her return from service he
was sure to greet her with some ironical jest which
made painfully clear that he regarded her habit
of worship as a sign of mental inferiority.  His
own habit on Sunday was to remain in bed until
after the church hour.  Then he would establish
himself in a loose-fitting woolen garment, which
he called his smoking-jacket, on the porch or in
the sitting-room and read the Sunday papers, with
a pipe in his mouth.  Sometimes he played on his
violin, and by the time Constance returned he was
ready for a short walk, ostensibly for the sake of
exercising a small black and white terrier.  His
wife could not accompany him on this stroll, for
she could not neglect their mid-day dinner, and
when he sat down at table he was apt, if the
weather was fine, to refer pathetically to the sin
of having wasted it in the city.  "If only you were
content, little saint, to worship nature with me,"
he would say, "we would get away into the country
with a luncheon basket the first thing in the
morning and make a day of it in the woods."
</p>

<p>
There was something winsome in this proposition,
especially as the inability to enjoy an outing
because of her reluctance to renounce church
worship seemed to spoil his day in a double sense.
For, as a consequence, he ate a huge Sunday
dinner, including two bottles of beer, smoked more
than his wont, and after a tirade against the evils
of monopoly or some kindred topic invariably fell
into a heavy slumber on the lounge, from which
he did not awaken until nearly sunset.
</p>

<p>
"Another Sunday wasted," he more than once
remarked by way of melancholy comment on this
state of affairs.
</p>

<p>
No wonder that Constance was perplexed as to
her duty.  Since coming to Benham she had been
a member of Rev. George Prentiss's parish.  Her
mother was of English descent, and Constance
had been brought up in the Episcopal faith.  At
Colton there had been no church of that denomination,
and to attend the Episcopal service one
had to drive or walk two miles to a neighboring
village.  It had often seemed to Constance more
important to remain at home with her invalid
mother than to take this excursion.  Consequently,
during her girlhood, she had been irregular
in her attendance at church.  Frequently, in order
to be able to return home more speedily, she had
worshipped at the Methodist or Unitarian
meeting-house in the village.  Sometimes she had
stayed away altogether; therefore she understood
the fascination of communion with books or with
spring buds or autumn leaves as a substitute for
worship in the sanctuary.  Her untrammelled
experience had made her open-minded and independent,
but on the other hand the difficulty of kneeling
at her own shrine had nourished her sentiment
for the Episcopal faith, so that she had rejoiced
spiritually in the opportunity, which her residence
in Benham afforded, to become a regular and
devoted member of Mr. Prentiss's flock.  Moreover,
the vital character of St. Stephen's as a
religious body had appealed to her.  The little
church near Colton had been a peaceful and poetic,
but poor and unenterprising establishment.
Contrasted with it, St. Stephen's appeared a splendid
and powerful influence for righteousness, stirring
deeply her æsthetic sensibilities, and at the same
time proving its living, practical grasp on human
character through its able pastor and active
organization.  St. Stephen's never slumbered;
St. Stephen's prided itself on its ardent faith and
essentially modern spirit; and St. Stephen's, by
common acceptance, was synonymous with its rector,
Rev. George Prentiss.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Prentiss had grown up with the church.
That is, he had been curate to the Rev. Henry
Glynn, an Englishman who had selected Benham
as a promising pasture for the propagation of the
Episcopal faith beyond the pale of the mother
country, who had gone forth into the wilderness
and had lived to see a goodly flock of sheep
browsing beneath his ministrations.  Mr. Glynn was a
pioneer, and had gone forth in the early seventies
when Benham was in the throes of rapid
progress and extraordinary development from
month to month.  His mission had been to spread
the tenets of his sect by the zeal and eloquence of
his testimony, and to provide a suitable edifice for
the human souls attracted by his teachings.  In
his time the congregation forsook the small and
primitive structure, erected in hot haste within a
year of his arrival, for a commodious and sufficiently
æsthetic building.  Before his death, which
occurred prematurely, Benham had become a
large and important municipality.  His successor
found himself not only the pastor of the leading
Episcopal Church of the city&mdash;which had also in
the process of social evolution become the most
fashionable and probably the richest church in
the city&mdash;but a shepherd in a wilderness of a
different sort.  In other words, he was brought
suddenly face to face with the problems which
confront earnest spirits eager to redeem human
nature in a huge industrial community.  The former
wilderness had blossomed, even with the rose,
but the thistles, tares, and rank grass which fought
for mastery with the wholesome vegetation had
revolutionized the soil.  There were scores of
saloons in Benham; there was a herd of immoral
women on the streets of Benham; and, most
perplexing problem of all, perhaps, there were, only
a mile apart, the picturesque neighborhood of the
Riverside Drive with its imposing, princely,
private mansions, and Smith Street, boulevard of
unwholesome tenement-houses, garnished with
rumshops and squalid lives&mdash;contrast repugnant and
disconcerting to American ideals, and to him as
an American.
</p>

<p>
But Rev. George Prentiss was not the man to
shrink from deep and important responsibilities.
On the contrary, it might be said of him that he
revelled in them.  The consciousness that, in spite
of Benham's mushroom-like growth as a proud
testimonial to the sacredness of institutions
established by the free-born, the city had begun closely
to resemble large cities everywhere was sobering,
but on the whole, inspiriting to him as a worker.
His mission was clearly disclosed to him&mdash;a
mission worthy of the energies of a clergyman eager
to bring his church into closer touch with
everyday life and common human conditions.  For
Mr. Prentiss as an American and a churchman was
ambitious for the future of the Episcopal faith.
His predecessor and friend had seen in their
pastorate only a glorious continuation of English
orthodoxy&mdash;a spiritual revolt from dissent,
transcendentalism and cold, intellectual independence,
which would, in the end, gather sixty million
people into a Protestant fold, national in its title and
dimensions.  Mr. Prentiss shared this delectable
vision, but he would not have American
Episcopacy a mere blind imitation of the mother
church or a colonial dependency.  He felt that it
behooved those of his faith on this side of the
Atlantic to gird their loins zealously, and to
guide their sheep fearlessly, receiving with
respectful attention the interpretations of the
spiritual lords of Great Britain regarding dogma,
but exercising intelligent discretion in regard to
their adoption.  This attitude, which might be
called patriotism, in some sense reflected the pride
which Dante, that stern censor of prelates,
condemns.  Was the Church of England to prescribe
doctrine to the thriving, hardy child of its loins
forever?  Surely not, now that that child, waxing
in size and resources and dignified with power,
promised soon to rival its parent.  It was agreeable
to the rector of St. Stephen's to reflect that
the tide of fashion was bearing the children of
Unitarian and other indeterminate faiths into the
fold of the true and living church of Christ.  It
was also agreeable to behold in his mind's eye that
church&mdash;the American church&mdash;taking advantage
of this splendid opportunity and accepting with
fearless and uncompromising zeal the challenge of
infidelity and materialism.  The people were tired,
he believed, of intellectual, spiritual dissipation,
in which each soul formed its own conception of
God, and defined the terms of its own compact
with Him.  They were welcoming fervor, passion,
color and all the symbols of a faith which
beholds in man a miserable sinner redeemed
through the blood of Christ.  If the people of his
nationality had been reluctant in the days of their
early history, when population was sparse and sin
was kept at bay by primitive economic conditions,
to admit that man was a sinner, could they doubt
it now?  Was not Benham with its bustling,
seething, human forces an eloquent testimonial to
the reality of evil and the intensity of the struggle
between the powers of darkness?  The Church's
mission&mdash;his mission&mdash;was to take an active part,
in a modern spirit, in the great work of regeneration
by bringing light to the blind, sympathy and
relief to the down-trodden and protection to the
oppressed.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Prentiss had carried his theories energetically
into practice.  He had striven to make St. Stephen's
a tabernacle for the prosperous and the
fortunate and also for the desolate and the
friendless.  His wish would have been to see them
intermingled at morning service without regard to
vested rights, but his wardens assured him that the
finances of the church could not be conducted
successfully except on the basis of inviolable pew
ownership until after the morning service had begun.
But he was able to throw the church open in the
afternoon to the general public, and to reserve in
the morning certain gallery and less desirable
benches for the accommodation of young men and
women students who wished to worship regularly
and could not afford to hire seats.  If it was at
first a tribulation to him that his congregation was
rich and fashionable and a little stolid, their
liberality on collection days was a great compensation,
for it gave him scope for extending his influence
along the line of his ambition by the establishment
of the mission church, known as the Church of
the Redeemer, in the heart of Benham's arid
social quarter, as an adjunct to St. Stephen's, and
to be maintained by the generosity of that body
of Christians.  When this undertaking was in full
operation, under the direction of a competent
curate, Mr. Prentiss experienced fewer qualms as
he looked down from his reading-desk at the gay
bonnets and costly toilets of his own parishioners.
He had been assured by several women active
in church work that the independent poor
were not fond of worshipping where their clothes
would show at a disadvantage.  As a Christian
who was an American, he deplored the formation
of classes in the sheep-fold of the church; yet he
reasoned that the preferences of human nature
could not be ignored altogether in a matter of this
kind, and it was evident that his parishioners
preferred to worship God in full possession of their
property rights, surrounded by their social
acquaintance.  There was a zest, too, in the
knowledge that he was the rector of the important and
powerful people of the city, and that he had the
opportunity to denounce the commercial spirit of
the age in the presence of men like Carleton
Howard, the millionaire, and women like his sister,
Mrs. Randolph Wilson, and their friends.  If he
could reach their hearts, what might he not hope
for?  Obviously by the support of this class the
Church could not fail to increase its revenues and
extend its power.  The triumph of the Church
was after all, for him, the essential thing&mdash;the
illumination of the souls of men through faith in
the Christian ideal.  So with this end constantly
in view, Rev. George Prentiss ministered to his
well-favored congregation in St. Stephen's, and
vicariously, and often by personal service,
conducted a crusade against ignorance and sin in the
Church of the Redeemer and its neighborhood.

<h3>
III
</h3>

<p>
Constance Forbes had been one of the
students who found a haven on the free
benches at St. Stephen's.  Almost at once
Mr. Prentiss noticed her and, struck by her interesting
face, he sent the church deaconess, Mrs. Hammond,
to visit her at her lodgings.  She was
invited to join a Bible class of young women of her
own age, and welcomed to the social parlor in the
vestry provided for girls who, like herself, were
strangers in Benham.  Here there were magazines,
writing materials, and afternoon tea.
While availing herself of these privileges,
Constance frequently met her rector.  He inquired
sympathetically concerning her work and aspirations,
and showed afterward that he kept her distinctly
in mind.  She felt that she could freely consult
him if she were in need of advice; once or
twice she did consult him about her reading; and
she was gratified by the interest which he took in
her marriage.
</p>

<p>
Consequently, the idea of not attending morning
service was distressing to her.  She felt sure
that Mr. Prentiss would notice it and be
disappointed.  Yet, what were Mr. Prentiss and his
feelings in comparison with her obligation to her
husband?  Emil's Sundays were spoiled because
she would not accompany him to the country
instead of going to church.  His attitude was
unreasonable and absurd, but the fact remained that he
did not go alone, and lounged at home instead.
After all, she was no longer a girl, and her
religious faith would not be imperilled were she to
miss church now and then.  Moreover, though
she held fast to her creed and deplored Emil's
radical views, she knew in her heart that she was
more critical than formerly of what she heard in
church, and that she was sometimes driven by her
doubts as to the possibility of supernatural
happenings to seek refuge behind the impenetrable
fortress of a righteous life.  There she was safe
and happy, and free, it seemed to her, from the
responsibility of harassing her young housewife's
brains with non-essentials.  Might it not be for
her own advantage to take a respite from religious
functions?  Certainly her companionship to Emil
seemed more important at the moment than her
own habit of public worship.
</p>

<p>
She began by staying away from church occasionally.
Emil expressed delight at her reasonableness
and carried out with zest his plan of a
Sunday outing.  It was a simple matter on their
bicycles, or by a few minutes in the train, to reach
country air and sylvan scenes, and he was entirely
satisfied to spend the day in tramping through the
woods and fields, stopping to fish or to lie in the
sun as the humor seized him.  The working-man's
Sabbath, he termed it.  The programme was
restful and alluring to Constance also.  Her husband
on these occasions seemed less at odds with the
world, and willing to enjoy himself without
rancor or argument.  After their luncheon he would
smoke complacently for awhile and then take up
his fiddle and practise upon it with genuine
content for an hour or more, while she sat with her
back against a tree or a bank, reading.  He still
drank his bottles of beer, but if he slumbered, it
was only for a brief period.  He never neglected
his fiddle, and its influence appeared, as it were,
to soothe his savage breast, and to make him
good-humored and agreeably philosophic.  He
was too fond of theorizing to neglect altogether
these opportunities for the enunciation of his
grievances against civilization, but he was lively
instead of bitter, a distinction which meant much
to his wife.
</p>

<p>
When their first baby was born, these Sunday
excursions were temporarily discontinued; but
Constance was eager to renew them, for Emil,
after going alone a few times, relapsed into his
old habits.  Accordingly, as soon as the little one
was able to toddle, a child's wagon was procured,
which Emil was ready to draw, and by avoiding
fences and other barriers, the difficulties presented
by this new tie were overcome.  By the time the
child was a year and a half old, Constance realized
that she had been to church but once in the last
twelve months.
</p>

<p>
This had been partly due to the action of the
rector of St. Stephen's, for Constance knew within
a few weeks of her first absences from church that
her conduct had been noticed.  The curate,
Mr. Starkworth, inquired at the door if there had been
illness in the family.  Later the deaconess made
a call of friendly observation, in the course of
which it transpired that Mr. Prentiss had
observed that Mrs. Stuart no longer occupied her
seat.  The culprit did not attempt to explain, and
within a fortnight she received a visit from the
rector himself.  No one could have been more
affable and reassuring.  He established himself
in an easy chair and accepted graciously the cigar
which Emil proffered him.  He was a large man
of dignified mien and commanding person, clerical
as to his dress and visage, but with a manner
of conversation approximating that of men of the
world&mdash;an individual manifestation which was
intended to reveal a modern spirit.  He was
clearly a person with whom liberties could not be
taken, and yet evidently one who desired to divest
his point of view of cant, and to put religion on a
man to man, business basis so far as was consistent
with his sacred calling.  He asked genial
questions concerning their domestic welfare, and
the progress of the new lumber firm, spoke
shrewdly of local politics in which he supposed
that Stuart was engaged, and sought obviously to
give the impression that he was an all-round man
in his sympathies, and that he took an active
interest in temporal matters.  When at last there
was a favorable pause in the current of this secular
conversation, Mr. Prentiss laid his hands on his
knees, and, bending forward and looking from
one to the other in a friendly way, said with
decision:
</p>

<p>
"I have missed you two young people at church
lately."
</p>

<p>

&quot;I have missed you two young people at church lately.&quot;
</p>

<p>
Constance winced at the inquiry, and her eyes
fell beneath the clergyman's searching gaze.  She
could not deny the impeachment, which was
embarrassing.  At the same time the color had
scarcely mounted to her cheeks before she felt the
force of her defence rising to her support, and she
looked up.  She appreciated that it was incumbent
on her, as the active church member, to respond,
and she became suddenly solicitous lest
Emil might, and so make matters worse.  In
truth, Emil's first impulse had been toward anger.
It was one of his maxims not to submit to
browbeating.  But what he regarded as the humor of
the proceeding changed his wrath into scorn, and
he closed his teeth on his pipe with the dogged air
of a master of the situation willing to be amused
withal.  Mr. Prentiss divined in a flash, from the
insolence of this expression, that he had to deal
with a hopeless case&mdash;so far as the human soul
can ever seem hopeless to the missionary&mdash;a
contemptuous materialist, and his own countenance
grew grave as he turned back to the wife.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, we have been very little, Mr. Prentiss.
My husband, you know, does not belong to your
church.  He went with me while we were engaged,
but&mdash;but now I think I can help him best by
staying away for the present."
</p>

<p>
"You go elsewhere, then?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  We do not go to church.  We spend our
Sundays in the country&mdash;in the fresh air, walking
and resting.  We take our luncheon, and my
husband brings his fiddle and his fishing rod."
</p>

<p>
Constance marvelled at her own boldness, and
at the ardor with which she delivered her plea of
justification.
</p>

<p>
"I understand," said Mr. Prentiss.  His tone
was sober, but not impatient.  The argument for
a day of rest and recreation for the tired man of
affairs was nothing new to him.  Nor was
Mr. Prentiss ignorant of its plausible value.  He
wished to meet it without temper, as one rational
being discussing with another, notwithstanding
eternal verities were concerned.
</p>

<p>
"Supposing, Mrs. Stuart, that everyone were
to reason in the same way, what would become of
our churches?"
</p>

<p>
"They would have to go out of commission,"
muttered Emil with delighted brusqueness.
</p>

<p>
The rector saw fit to bear this brutality
without offence.  He ignored the commentator with
his eyes, as though to indicate that his mission was
solely to the wife, but he answered,
</p>

<p>
"They would, and the Christian faith would
perish in the process.  Are you, Mrs. Stuart," he
continued, "prepared to do without the offices of
religion, and to substitute for them a pagan
holiday?"
</p>

<p>
"We pass the day very quietly and simply,"
said Constance.  "We disturb no one and
interfere with no one."
</p>

<p>
"But you become pagans, utterly."
</p>

<p>
"I try to think that God hears my prayers in
the open air no less than in church, while I am
keeping my husband company."  It wounded her
to oppose her rector, yet the need of a champion
for her husband's cause supplied her with speech,
and gave to her countenance quiet determination.
Constance possessed one of those lithe, nervous
personalities, so frequently to be met with in
American women of every class, the signal
attribute of which is bodily and mental refinement.
Her hair was dark, her face thin, her eyes brown
and wistful, her figure tall and elastic; her pretty
countenance had the charm of temperament rather
than mere flesh and blood, and its sympathetic,
intelligent comeliness suggested spiritual vigor.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Prentiss was not blind to these qualities.
They had attracted him at the beginning of their
acquaintance, and he was the more solicitous on
account of them to reclaim her from error.
</p>

<p>
"God hears your prayers wherever you utter
them, be assured of that.  But I ask you to
consider whether the habit of neglecting public
worship is not a failure in reverence to the Christ who
listens to our supplications and without whose aid
we are helpless to overcome sin."
</p>

<p>
Emil had been delighted by his wife's sturdy
attitude.  Now that a question of doctrine was
brought into the discussion, he felt that the time
had come for him to intervene again.  "We who
worship in the presence of nature are not
hampered by dogmas of that kind," he said.
"Temptation is temptation, and I for one have never
been able to understand why the man who gets
the better of it isn't entitled to the credit of his
strength and sense.  My wife looks at such things
very much as I do."
</p>

<p>
"Not altogether, Emil.  You know I miss not
going to church."
</p>

<p>
"I have never prevented you from going."
</p>

<p>
"But you have discountenanced it, man.  It is
to please you, and to humor your views that your
wife is sacrificing her most sacred convictions,"
Mr. Prentiss exclaimed with a touch of sternness.
</p>

<p>
"You think church-going of the utmost
importance; I do not.  There's where we differ.
Everyone must decide those questions for
himself&mdash;or herself."
</p>

<p>
The rector resented the smug assurance of the
retort by a frown and a twist of his shoulders, as
though he were sorry that he had condescended
to bandy words with this irreverent person.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, we all must," he said, addressing Constance.
"'He that loveth father or mother more
than me is not worthy of me.'"
</p>

<p>
He regretted the next instant having indulged
in this clerical formula, which was foreign to his
usual method.
</p>

<p>
Constance flushed at the words of Scripture,
then she drew herself up slightly and said:
</p>

<p>
"I am very sorry, indeed, to disappoint you,
Mr. Prentiss, but I can't promise to attend church
regularly at present.  Perhaps it is true, as my
husband says, that my opinions have changed
somewhat in regard to points of faith.  I hope&mdash;I
shall pray that after a time we may both come
back to you."
</p>

<p>
There was no mistaking the finality of this
unequivocal but gently uttered speech, and
Mr. Prentiss knew that one of the signs of a man of
the world is the capacity to take a hint.  Though
it galled him to leave this attractive member of
his flock in the clutches of one so apparently unfit
to appreciate her bodily or spiritual graces, he
recognized that to press the situation at this point
could result only in separating her still further
from the influence of the church.  "You shall
have my prayers, too&mdash;both of you," he said,
fervently.  Then he arose and resumed the demeanor
of a friendly caller.
</p>

<p>
But Emil, now that he had shown clearly that
he had the courage of his convictions, felt the need
of vindicating his character as a host.  He said
jauntily, "I hope there's no offence in standing up
for what one believes to be true.  It's one of the
greatest poets, you know, who wrote
</p>

<p class="poem">
  There lives more faith in honest doubt,<br />
  Believe me, than in half the creeds."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"You young whipper snapper!" was Mr. Prentiss's
unuttered comment, but he did not relax his
lay serenity of manner save by the slight vein of
sarcasm which his words contained.  "No offence,
certainly.  But you should also bear in mind,
young man, that others no less mentally qualified
than yourself have pondered the problems of the
universe and come to very different conclusions.
A man takes large responsibilities upon himself
in deciding to deprive his wife and children of the
comforts of religion."
</p>

<p>
"I am anxious that my children when they grow
up may not be obliged, as I was, to unlearn what
they were taught to believe in their youth," Emil
retorted with smiling effrontery.  He was pleased
with his wife and with himself and he was glad to
get in a final body blow on the person of this
officious slummer, as he subsequently described
their visitor.
</p>

<p>
"I am not unfamiliar with that line of argument,"
said Mr. Prentiss, in the act of departure.
"But I invite you to consider whether your children,
when they are old enough to think for themselves,
will be grateful for the substitute which
you offer for doctrine.  They ask for bread, and
what do you give them?  A stone."
</p>

<p>
Emil laughed.  He was content to let the
parson have the last word.  He stood for a moment
on the door-step watching him march down the
street.  He felt that he had turned the tables on
him completely and had thereby won a victory for
clear thinking and freedom of thought.  He
exclaimed exultantly as he re-entered the parlor, "I
guess that'll teach the old duck to stay in his own
barn-yard and not come waddling down here to
try to get us to believe that the world was made in
seven days and Jonah was swallowed by the
whale."
</p>

<p>
Constance, who had fallen into troubled reverie,
looked up and exclaimed with emphasis, "Mr. Prentiss
is a very reasonable man about such matters,
Emil.  He used particularly to tell his Bible
class that the language of the Old Testament is
sometimes metaphorical."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know how the clergy jump and change
feet to avoid being cornered.  I'm aware they
explain that the seven days were not our days of
twenty-four hours, but were symbolic terms for
geological stretches of time.  Do you call that
ingenuous?"
</p>

<p>
Constance winced.  It happened that Mr. Prentiss
had offered just this explanation of holy writ,
and somehow, now that Emil held it up to scorn,
the rector's commentary appeared flimsy.  She
sighed, then with emotion said, "Emil, I wish you
would tell me what you really do believe."
</p>

<p>
"Believe?"  He smiled indulgently as he
echoed his wife's inquiry, but his eyes snapped and
his shock of hair seemed to stand up straighter.
His manner expressed a mixture of amused
condescension and the tartness of a dogged spirit
suspicious of attack.  "I believe, for one thing, that
the laws of nature are never violated, and that
their integrity is a grander attribute of divinity
than the various sensational devices which the
orthodox maintain that an all-wise God employs
to attract the attention of men to Himself.  I
believe also that you in your secret soul entirely agree
with me."
</p>

<p>
Constance was silent a moment.  "And yet you
haven't answered my question, Emil.  You haven't
told me what you do believe.  Why isn't religion
just as real and true a part of man as any other
instinct of his being?  It has been a constantly
growing attribute."
</p>

<p>
"And the nonsense is being gradually squeezed
out of it.  Why should I accept the dogma of that
reverend father in God that a man can do nothing
by his own efforts?  Isn't it a finer thought
that we grow by virtue of our struggles and that
the free and independent soul wins the battle of
life by making the most of itself?"
</p>

<p>
Emil spoke with fierce rhetoric.  To his wife's
ear he seemed to be pointing out besides that his
own soul was fighting this battle and that he was
willing to be judged by the results regardless of
doctrine.  Constance had long ago convinced
herself that his bark was worse than his bite; that he
believed more than he really admitted of the
essentials of religion; that he acknowledged his
responsibility to God and was devoting his days to
advancing the useful work of the world, and
incidentally providing for her happiness at the same
time.  His plea for credit to the independent soul
which overcame temptation and obstacles was, at
least, manly, and a sign of courage.  She scarcely
heeded the quotation from the "Rubaiyat," which
he was murmuring as a corollary to his apostrophe
to free and noble endeavor.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  O thou who didst with pitfall and with gin<br />
  Beset the path I was to wander in,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou wilt not with predestined evil round<br />
  Enmesh and then impute my fall to sin?<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
She had heard him quote these lines and others
of like import before, and she had learned some
of them by rote.  She recognized their charm and
cleverness and to a certain extent their plausibility;
but she had not the slightest impulse to revolutionize
her own faith.  Her absorbing thought,
for the moment, was how to be true to her husband
without being false to the church.  Mr. Prentiss,
in spite of his appeal, had left her conscience
unconvinced, and now her clear-headed, fearless Emil
had suddenly given her soul the cue to expression.
Her brown eyes kindled rapturously and trustfully
as she said:
</p>

<p>
"It's the life after all which counts, isn't it?
Everything else is of secondary importance."
</p>

<p>
"Of course," said Emil.  "And when it comes
to that," he added, "there's no one in the world
who can pick a flaw in yours, you little saint."
</p>

<p>
"You mustn't say things like that," Constance
murmured.  Nevertheless, so far as it was a
manifestation of confidence from the man she loved, it
was pleasant to hear.
</p>

<p>
From this time her attendance at church was
very infrequent.  She did not cease to go
altogether, but almost every Sunday was spent in
expeditions in the open air.  The cares resulting
from the birth of two children necessarily
interfered with her going regularly to service while
they were infants, and as soon as they were able
to walk, the Sunday outings were resumed with
the little boy and girl as companions.  Mr. Prentiss
did not revisit the house, but on each of the
two or three occasions when Constance occupied
her old seat in St. Stephen's, she felt that the
rector had noticed her.  He had apparently left her
to her devices, but his glance told her that she was
not forgotten.

IV

<p>
It is fitting and fortunate that a young woman
in a large city, who has given her happiness
into the keeping of a man with his own way to
make, should be ignorant of her peril, and that
charmed by love she should take for granted that
he will succeed.  But the rest of the world has no
excuse for being equally blind, since the rest of
the world is aware that there is no recipe by which
a girl of twenty can secure a guaranty either of
domestic happiness or ability on the part of her
lover to hold his own in the competition for a
livelihood.  It is easy for the moralist of society,
writing at his desk, to utter the solemn truth that
young people should not rush hastily into
matrimony.  Assuredly they should not.  But after
all, is it to be wondered at that so many of them
do?  Love is the law of life.  The renewal of
the race through the union of the sexes is an
instinct which asserts itself in spite of code and
thesis, and the institution of lawful wedlock is the
bit by which civilization regulates it.  Let us, says
the modern scientist, isolate the degenerate members
of society, the diseased, the vicious, and the
improvident, and prevent them from having
offspring.  But still the priest of Rome, eager for
fresh converts, but wise, too, in his knowledge of
the law of sex, whispers to his flock "marry early,"
and adds under his breath, "lest ye sin."  It is a
part of religion, perhaps, for the daughters of
the well-to-do, who have been screened from
contact with the rough world, and who sit in
judgment on several lovers in the paternal drawing-room,
to weigh and ponder and to call in the brain
to assist, or if needs be, silence the heart.  Yet
even they sometimes elope instead with the wrong
man against whom they have been warned, and
are unhappy&mdash;or happy&mdash;ever afterward.  But
when we turn from these privileged young
persons&mdash;the pretty, daintily dressed young women in
their Easter bonnets, who worship at our
fashionable churches&mdash;and from some height look out
over wide stretches of streets with every house
alike, the homes of the average working population,
and reflect that every house shelters the
consequences of a marriage, shall we ask pitilessly,
"How came ye so?"  And if the answer of some
be "we met and loved and married, and now we
are miserable," shall we draw ourselves up and
tell them that the fault is theirs, that marriages
are (or should be) made in heaven, and that they
ought to have discovered before they plighted
their troth that John would be a rascal or Mary
a slattern?  Is it not the privilege and the
blessing of the young to trust?  Shall we blame them
if, in the ignorance of youth and under the spell
of the law of their beings, they mistake unworthy
souls for their ideals?
</p>

<p>
The firm of Stuart &amp; Robinson, dealers in
lumber, had started with a small capital, but the
senior partner had confidence in his capacity to
do a large business.  His late employers, Toler
&amp; Company, according to his opinion, had been
old fogies in their methods.  To adopt his own
metaphor, instead of getting up early and shaking
the trees, they expected to have ripe peaches
served to them on Sevrès china, or, in other
words, they let great opportunities slip through
their fingers.  He proceeded during the first year
to carry out several enterprises which he had vainly
called to their attention while in their service, and
he had the satisfaction of proving his wisdom
and of doubling the firm's assets at the same time.
Emil's plans were essentially on a large scale, and
he was confessedly cramped even after this
success.  He explained to his wife that if only he
had the necessary capital, he would be able at one
fell swoop to control the lumber yards and
lumber market of Benham.  As it was, he must wait
and probably see others appropriate ideas which
he had suggested by his novel and brilliant
operations.  The prophecy indeed proved true, and
Emil saw with a morose eye what he called his
harvest gleaned by others.  This vindictive
attitude toward the successful was the invariable
frame of mind into which he relapsed when he was
not carrying everything before him, and as a
result those in the trade presently began to speak of
him as a crank.  His quick comprehension was
admitted, but his associates shook their heads when
his name was mentioned, and hinted that he was
a dangerous man, who would bear watching.  It
was almost inevitable that a lean period should
follow Emil's series of clever undertakings.
Toward the end of the second year, he found
himself in a position where he had not the means to
enlarge the scope of his operations.  His working
capital was locked up in sundry purchases
which he had expected would show quick profits,
but which hung fire.  If he liquidated, it must be
at a loss, and the idea of a loss was always bitter
to him.  During a number of months he was
obliged to renounce certain plans which he had in
view and to remain inactive.  A falling lumber
market added to his complications.  Prompt to
act when he was convinced of error, he sold out
at last his accumulated stock at a loss, which
would have been much greater had he delayed a
week longer.  But he was left almost in the same
position as when he started; the previous profits
had been cut in two.  This was wormwood to his
restless soul.  It made him moody and cynical at
home, where one child and the near advent of
another foreshadowed increasing expenses.  He had
expected by this time to be on the high road to
fortune, and to be imitating the swift progress of
certain individuals in Benham, who even in the
short period since he had been a citizen, had risen
by their superior wits from poverty to affluence
and power.
</p>

<p>
But Emil's fits of depression were invariably
succeeded by intervals of buoyancy.  Though he
still talked bitterly at home of the methods by
which cold-hearted capital squeezed the small man
to the wall and robbed him of his gains, he began
to scheme anew, and to argue that the assets in
his control were still ample for a great success if
shrewdly handled.  The lumber market was in
the doldrums, dull and drooping.  It began to
look as though some of the industries of Benham
had been developed too rapidly, and as though a
halt, or what financiers call a healthy reaction in
values, were in order.  Could it be possible that
all prices in Benham were inflated?  The idea
occurred to Emil one day, and he jumped at it
eagerly.  It took possession of him.  He feverishly
began to examine statistics, and found that
Benham had experienced only one period of
depression since its birth as a city at the close of the
Civil War.  It was time for another, and the men
who were clever enough to anticipate it would
reap the reward of their sagacity.  What were
the staples of Benham?  Oil, pork, and
manufactured iron.  These were the industries which
had given the chief impetus to the city's growth,
and were its great source of wealth.  Emil
pondered the situation and decided to sell pork short.
If a general shrinkage in values was impending,
the price of pork was certain to decline.  He had
hitherto felt so confident of making money in his
own line of business that he had never done more
than cast sheep's eyes at the stock market or the
markets in grain, oil, and pork futures.  It had
been his expectation to try ventures of this sort
as soon as his capital was large enough for
important transactions.  It was a favorite notion of
his that after he had acquired the first one
hundred thousand dollars, he would be able to
quadruple it in a very short time by bold dealings in
stocks or commodities.  He knew now that he had
merely to step into a broker's office and sell pork
in Chicago by wire.  It was a simple thing to do
and the shrewd thing, considering his own
business offered no opportunity at the moment for
brilliancy.
</p>

<p>
To speak to his partner seemed to Emil unnecessary.
He promised himself that after he had
put the firm on its feet again he would deal
generously with Robinson.  Since their late reverses
the partnership was not borrowing much money,
so its credit was not exhausted.  Emil obtained
from his bank as large a loan as he dared to ask
for, and began to sell pork short on the strength
of the proceeds.  It was a process which requires
small capital at the outset.  That is, he had simply
to keep his margin good in case the pork which
he sold rose in value.  To begin with he sold only
a few hundred barrels, and within a fortnight the
price fell smartly.  Not only the price of pork,
but of stocks, grain, and merchandise.  Emil
congratulated himself.  Evidently he was correct in
his judgment that a period of lower speculative
values was at hand.  The proper thing would be
to sell everything and reap a huge fortune before
the dull general public awoke to the truth.  His
own limited resources forbade this, which was
irritating.  Still, he could go on selling pork short,
and this he continued to do.
</p>

<p>
The proceeding elated him, for the sudden and
large profit was in a sense a revelation.  He
regretted that he had never before tried this method
of demonstrating his business shrewdness.  He
felt that it suited him admirably.  He would be
no rash-headed fool; he would sell boldly, but
intelligently; he would keep his eye on the general
market, and not cover his shorts until the general
situation changed.  If a serious decline in the
prices of everything were in store for Benham&mdash;and
the indications of this were multiplying from
week to week&mdash;the price of pork might drop out
of sight, so to speak, and he win a fortune as a
consequence.  It was the chance of a lifetime.  He
reasoned that he would keep cool and make a big
thing of it; that a small fellow would be content
with a few thousands and run to cover, but he
intended to be one of the big fellows.  Why take his
profit when the whole financial horizon was
ominous with clouds, and money was becoming
tighter every day?
</p>

<p>
Emil's reasoning was perfect.  The course of
prices was exactly as he had predicted; that is, the
price of everything except pork.  The unexpected
happened there, and this from a cause which no
shrewd person could have foreseen.  One day
when, in the parlance of trade, the bottom seemed
to be dropping out of all the markets, a despatch
appeared in the newspapers stating that a peculiar
disease had broken out among the hogs in Western
Illinois.  The pork market stiffened, but became
flat at the advance after somebody declared
the story to be a canard invented by the bulls to
bolster up their holdings.  Emil, adopting this
explanation, and certain that this cunning
stratagem to check the decline would prove unavailing,
sold more pork.
</p>

<p>
A week later&mdash;one Saturday preceding a Monday
which was to be a holiday&mdash;there were rumors
in Chicago, just before the close of the Exchange,
that the disease among the hogs was no mere local
manifestation; that it was spreading rapidly, and
had already shown itself in Indiana and Ohio.
Pork in the last fifteen minutes bounded upward
and closed ominously strong.  Before the market
opened on the following Tuesday it was definitely
known that the hogs of the country were in the
grasp of an epidemic, the precise character of
which, to quote the press, was not yet determined,
but which, in the opinion of those most competent
to judge, would render the flesh of the animals
attacked by the dread disease unfit for food, and
their lard unwholesome.  When the market
opened, the price of pork was so high that Emil's
margin of protection was wiped out as thoroughly
as the tide wipes out the sand dyke which a child
erects upon the beach.  He was unable to respond
to the demand made on him for money to keep
his account with his broker good, and was sold out
before night at a loss&mdash;a loss which left him in
debt.  He went home knowing that he was bankrupt,
and that his firm must fail the moment his
note at the bank became due, even if the broker to
whom he owed five thousand dollars over and
above his margins did not press him.  There was
no escape from ruin and humiliation.
</p>

<p>
He disclosed the truth to Constance with the
repressed bitterness of a Prometheus.  He
explained to her with the mien of a wounded animal
at bay the cruelty of the trick of destiny which
had crushed him.  How had he been at fault?  He
had been shrewd, far-seeing and prompt to act.
The wisdom of his course had been demonstrated
by the fall in prices.  He was on the high road to
fortune, and fate had stabbed him in the back.
Could any intelligent man have foreseen that the
hogs of the country would be stricken with
disease?  And more galling still, why had luck
played him false by singling out the only possible
combination of events which could have done him
harm?
</p>

<p>
"An all-wise Providence!" he ejaculated with a
scornful laugh.  "A man looks the ground over,
uses his wits and is reaping the benefit of his
intelligence when he is struck in the head with a brick
from behind a hedge, and is then expected to
glorify the hand which smote him.  How could it
have been helped?  How was I to blame?" he
reiterated with a fierce look at his wife.
</p>

<p>
Constance could not answer the question.  The
details of business were a sealed book to her.  The
brief account of the disaster in pork, which he had
just given, was confusing to her, and had left her
with no conviction save pity for her husband.  She
was ready to take his word, and to believe that
this overwhelming misfortune was the result of
ill-luck which could not have been guarded against.
What was uppermost in her mind was the impulse
to help and comfort him.  It pained her that he
should inveigh against fate, though she recognized
that the provocation was severe.  But he needed
her now more than ever.  She would be brave and
let him see that her love was at his command.
</p>

<p>
"You mustn't mind too much, Emil," she said.
"We have to start again, that's all.  I can
economize in lots of ways, and we shall manage
somehow, I'm sure.  We have the house, you know.
If it's necessary&mdash;in order to set you up in
business&mdash;we can mortgage that.  We've always had
that to fall back on."
</p>

<p>
She knew as she spoke that from the standpoint
of prudence the offer of the house was unwise.  If
that were gone, what would become of her children?
Yet she felt a joy in tendering it.  Why
did her husband look at her with that malevolent
gaze as though she had contributed to his distress?
</p>

<p>
"If you had put a mortgage on the house when
I first started in business, and had given me the
benefit of a larger capital, then we shouldn't be
where we are to-day.  I wanted it at the time, but
you didn't offer it."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Emil.  I never dreamt that you wished it.
To mortgage our home then would have been rash,
surely.  Besides, if I had given it to you, wouldn't
it have been lost with the rest now?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't you understand," he said, roughly, "that
if I had not been hampered at the start by my
small capital, I should never have been forced to
go outside the lumber business in order to support
my family?  Another five thousand dollars would
have made all the difference."
</p>

<p>
His glowering look seemed to suggest that he
had persuaded himself that she was partly to blame
for what had happened.  Constance was ready to
make every allowance for him, but his mood
offered fresh evidence of the crankiness of his
disposition, a revelation to which her devotion could
not altogether blind her.
</p>

<p>
"I don't understand anything about the business
part," she answered, putting her arm around his
neck.  "Oh, Emil, Emil, I'm so sorry for you!  I
wish to do everything I can to help you and show
my love for you.  This is a dreadful sorrow for
you to bear&mdash;for us both to bear.  But it has come
to us, and we mustn't be discouraged.  God will
give us strength to bear it if we let him."
</p>

<p>
"God?" he blurted.  "You may leave God out
of the question so far as I am concerned."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Emil, it grieves me to hear you talk like
that."
</p>

<p>
"And it grieves me that you should aggravate
my trouble by cant which I thought you had outgrown."
</p>

<p>
"I shall never outgrow that," she murmured,
appreciating suddenly that the substitute which he
offered her for spiritual resignation was a cell
bounded by four stone walls.  She had reached
the limit of her apostacy, and she shrank
irrevocably from the final step.
</p>

<p>
"Of course the rich and the powerful and the
fortunate," he was saying, "encourage the delusion
that if a man's knocked out as I am he ought to
believe it's for the best, because rubbish of that
sort keeps together the social system on which they
fatten.  Do the poor in the tenements in Smith
Street over there," he asked with a wave of his
hand, "believe it's for the best that they should go
hungry and in rags while Carleton Howard and
his peers imitate Antony and Cleopatra?  Ask the
operatives in the factories across the river what
they think of the justice of the millionaire's God?
The time has passed when you can fool the
self-respecting workingman with a basket of coals and
a tract on the kingdom of heaven.  They may have
their heaven, if they'll give us a fair share of this
earth."  Emil folded his arms as one issuing an
ultimatum.
</p>

<p>
Constance realized that he was in no mood to
be reasoned with.  She had made clear that she
could not subscribe to his doctrine of despair, and
save in that respect she was eager to be sympathetic.
She could not deny the inequalities and
apparent injustice of civilization, and Emil's plea
that he had been crushed by an accident which he
could not have avoided not only wrung her heart,
but filled it with a sense of hostility to an industrial
system which permitted its deserving members to
be crushed without fault of their own.  But she
felt instinctively that the best sort of succor which
she could bring was of the practical kind.
To-morrow was before them, God or no God, and
they must adjust themselves to their altered
circumstances, take thought and build their hopes
anew.
</p>

<p>
She put her arm around his neck again and
kissed him silently.  Then she began with quiet
briskness to make preparations for the evening
meal.  It was the maid's afternoon out, and
Constance moved as though she were glorying in the
occupation.  Presently she said:
</p>

<p>
"Of course I'll dismiss Sophy to-morrow.  I am
proud to be a workingman's wife, Emil.  We'll
soon be on our feet again, never fear."
</p>

<p>
The suggestion of the servant's dismissal
deepened the gloom on Emil's face.  "I've half a
mind to pull up stakes and move to New York,"
he muttered.
</p>

<p>
"And give up our home?"
</p>

<p>
He frowned at the involuntary concern in her
voice.  "What use is a home in a place where a
man is cramped and circumvented in every big
thing he attempts?  I ought to have moved long
ago."
</p>

<p>
"I am ready to live wherever you think best,
Emil.  And you mustn't forget, dear, that my trust
and faith in you are as great as ever."
</p>

<p>
Despondent as he was, his habit of buoyancy
was already groping for some clue to a brighter
vision, to which his wife's words of encouragement
now helped him.  He was sitting with his elbows
resting on the table and his head clasped between
his hands.  "I'll make a fresh start&mdash;here," he
said.  "They've got me down, but, damn them,
I'll show them that they can't keep me there."
</p>

<p>
Presently he arose, and walking out to the
kitchen reappeared with a goblet and two bottles
of beer.  One of these he uncorked and poured the
contents ostentatiously so that the froth gathered.
Raising the glass he buried his mouth in the beer
and eagerly drank it off.  He set down the goblet
with a sigh of satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
"And what's more," he said, "they can't deprive
me of that."
</p>

<p>
Constance watched him with a troubled look.
She shrank at this time of his distress from intimating
that she regarded the indulgence of this appetite
as a poor sort of solace.  Besides, a glass of
beer was in itself nothing, and he might well take
offence at her solicitude as an invasion of his
reasonable comfort.  Yet observation had taught her
that he was becoming more and more fond of
seeking a respite from care in liberal potations of
this sort.
</p>

<p>
She restrained her inclination to interfere, but
she saw him with concern consume four bottles
in the course of the evening.  The serenity of
temper which this produced&mdash;the almost indifferent
calm following the storm&mdash;was by no means
encouraging.  To be sure his ugly side seemed
entirely in abeyance.  Indeed, he took down his
fiddle and played on it seductively until he went
to bed, as though there were no such things as
business troubles.  But somehow the very mildness
of his mood, gratifying as it was to her from
the momentary personal standpoint, disturbed her.
Was this good nature the manly, Christian
resignation of the victim of misfortune putting aside
his grief until the morrow?  It suggested to her
rather the relaxation of a baffled soul exchanging
ambition for a nepenthe of forgetfulness&mdash;a fuddled
agitator's paradise&mdash;and her heart was wrung with dread.

<p>
The firm of Stuart &amp; Robinson, lumber
dealers, was hopelessly insolvent and did not
attempt to resume business.  The partners
separated with sentiments of mutual disdain.  To the
junior&mdash;the dummy&mdash;the failure had come as a
cruel surprise.  He refused to regard Emil's
conduct as reasonable or honorable, despite the
assurance that the speculation in pork had been for
their common benefit, and that, but for an
untoward accident, the result would have been a
fortune for the firm.  On the other hand, Emil
expressed scorn for a nature so pusillanimous that
it saw only the outcome and failed utterly to
appreciate the brilliancy of his undertaking.  As Emil
explained to his wife, the decision of the partners
in regard to the future was typical of their
respective dispositions; Robinson, having lost his
money, was soliciting a clerkship&mdash;a return to
servitude; whereas Emil intended to strike out for
himself again.
</p>

<p>
In what field of energy were his talents to be
exercised next?  This was for Emil the first and
most important consideration.  His new employment
must be of a kind which would provide him
with bread and butter until he was on his feet
again, but would not deprive him of scope and
independence.  It must be something which would
not require capital.  Yet this did not mean that
his talent for speculation was to be neglected, but
merely to be kept in abeyance until he saw just the
opportunity to use to advantage the three thousand
dollars which he promptly raised by a second
mortgage on his wife's house.  His failure had
left him more than ever confident of his ability to
achieve success by bold and comprehensive methods.
But in the meantime, while he was spinning
the web of fresh enterprises which were to make
him prosperous, he must support his family somehow.
</p>

<p>
He concluded to become a newspaper reporter
and writer of articles for the press.  This would
provide an immediate income and would not interfere
unduly with other projects.  Besides it would
enable him to give public expression to some of
his opinions, which would be an æsthetic
satisfaction.  He also engaged desk-room in an office
shared by four men independent of one another
and interchangeably petty lawyers, traders and
dealers in mortgages and land.  On the glass door
one read "Real Estate and
Mortgages&mdash;Investments&mdash;Collections&mdash;Loans&mdash;Notary
Public."  Below were the names of the occupants, followed
by the titles of several wildcat companies, the
dregs of oil and mining ventures in the
neighborhood of Benham, of which one of them was the
promoter and treasurer.  It seemed to Emil a
location where he, hampered by circumstances
from jostling elbows with men of means, might
use his wits profitably until he could see his way
to more imposing quarters.  Here he would be
unobserved and yet not wholly out of touch with
what was going on.  On the same floor of the
building, which was a hive of small concerns, there
was a broker's office which had a wire to Chicago
and knowing correspondents in New York.  That
it was described as a "bucket shop" by more
prosperous banking firms prejudiced Emil in its favor;
he ascribed the stigma to capitalistic envy and
social ostracism.  He became friendly with the
proprietor, discussed with him the merits of the
wares on his counter, and presently, acting on
"tips" obtained from this source, captured on
several occasions sums ranging from ten to fifty
dollars by the purchase of ten shares of stock or an
equivalent amount of grain, requiring an advance
on his own part of not more than three per cent. of
the purchase price&mdash;a mere bagatelle.  This as
a beginning was satisfactory.  It eked out his
journalistic income; and the skill with which he
plied the process, contrasted with the folly
displayed by most of the customers, flattered the faith
which he had in his sound judgment.  This
broker's shop was the resort of scores of people
of small means, trades-folk, clerks, salaried
dependents and some women, keen to acquire from
the fluctuations of the speculative markets a few
crumbs of the huge gains garnered by the magnates
of Wall Street, of which they read emulously
in the newspapers.  To put up one's thirty dollars,
and to have one's margin of venture or profit
wiped out within twenty-four hours, was the normal
experience, sooner or later, of ninety per
cent. of these unfortunates.  The remainder were
shrewder and longer lived, and to this remnant
Emil indisputably belonged.
</p>

<p>
He obtained a position on the <i>Star</i>, a sensational,
popular one-cent paper.  The <i>Star</i> was read
both by the workingmen in the manufacturing
plants, of whose interests it was a zealous
champion, and by a large class of business men and
trades-people, who found its crisp paragraphs and
exaggerated, inaccurate reports of current horrors
and scandals an agreeable form of excitement.
Emil's employment was to make the round of the
dealers in grain, lumber, wool and other staples
and report trade prices and gossip, which under
the control of the financial editor he was allowed
to expand into commercial prognostications or
advice.  To the Sunday edition he began to
contribute special articles exploiting the grievances of
the proletariat, which the management of the <i>Star</i>
accepted and presently invited as a weekly feature.
They were written with a sardonic acerbity of
touch, which afforded him an outlet for his
disgruntled frame of mind and free scope for his
favorite theories.  He also renewed his
attendance at the Socialistic Club which he had
frequented before his marriage, and became one of
the orators there.  It occurred to him that a
political office would be acceptable while he was
husbanding his resources.  Why not become alderman
on the workingman's ticket?  There was a salary
of five hundred dollars attached, and as a city
father he would have opportunities to know what
was going on in municipal affairs, and to get an
inkling of some of the big schemes projected by
capitalists, for the furtherance of which his vote
would be required.  He would be able also&mdash;and
this was an exhilarating consideration&mdash;to hold
the whip-hand over the arrogant moneyed men
seeking franchises for next to nothing, by which to
extort millions from the guileless common people.
While Emil, with recovered buoyancy, readjusted
his plans to meet his circumstances and set
his wits to work, his wife met the necessity of
strict economy with absorbed devotion.  She
signed the mortgage with a pang, but without
hesitancy.  She appreciated the necessity of the
contribution.  Without ready money Emil would
be powerless&mdash;must become a mere clerk or
subordinate, and his ambition would be crushed.  She
would have preferred perhaps that he should
resign himself to the situation, and without
imperilling their home, support his family on a modest
footing by a salary or by the journalistic work
for which he had an aptitude.  But she recognized
that his heart was set on independent success on a
large scale, and that Emil thwarted or repressed
would become an irritable and despondent malcontent.
His shrewdness had nearly gained him a
fortune, and apparently a cruel freak of chance
had been solely responsible for his discomfiture.
She did not pretend to criticise the nature of his
business dealings.  He had explained to her that
capital was indispensable to the realization of his
aims.  She must trust him.  She did suggest that
he should use the proceeds of the mortgage for
the payment of his debts.  The thought of doing
so was bitter, and she was thankful when Emil
assured her with a protesting scoff that such a
proceeding would be Utopian.  "What," he asked,
"was the sense of insolvent laws, if, when a man
failed in business, his wife was to cast her little
all, her own patrimony, into the common pot for
the enrichment of his creditors?  Business people
understood that they were taking business chances,
and did not expect to gobble up the home of a
wife bought with her own genuine means.  If she
were rich, generosity might be honesty, but in the
present instance, it would be sentimental folly."  This
was convincing to Constance, for she felt
instinctively that her children must have rights as
well as the creditors.  A woman's whimsical
conception of business honor might well be at fault.
She had made her offer, and she was glad to abide
by her husband's superior knowledge.
</p>

<p>
Her duty obviously was to reduce the scale of
family living without interfering with Emil's
reasonable comfort or wounding his self-respect.  She
gave herself up to her work of domestic economy
with fresh zeal, doing the manual labor of the
household with enthusiasm.  By steady industry
and thoughtful care, she was able not only to
minimize expenses, but to produce presentable
results from a small outlay.  Her heart was in it;
for was not Emil at work again and hopeful?  She
was proud of his newspaper articles and regarded
his small gains from shrewd speculations as new
proof of his capacity for financial undertakings.
</p>

<p>
The end of a year found Emil rather more than
holding his own pecuniarily.  He had obtained
commissions as a broker from the successful
negotiation of a few small real-estate transactions,
his ventures on a cautious scale in the stock market
had been almost invariably fortunate, and his
earnings as a newspaper writer had been sufficient
with these accretions to cover his household
expenses, pay the interest on the mortgage, and add
slightly to his capital.  He felt that he was on his
feet again, and was correspondingly bumptious;
yet he realized that his recuperation regarded as
progress was a snail's pace, which must be greatly
accelerated if he would attain wealth and
importance.  In this connection the idea of
becoming an alderman kept recurring to him with
increasing attraction.  At present he was nobody.
His name was unfamiliar and his position obscure.
This irritated him, for he craved recognition and
publicity.  To be sure, while capital was at his
disposal, he had seen fit to address his efforts
solely to the accumulation of a fortune as the
passport to power, but even then he had been at heart
a sworn enemy of the moneyed class.  And now
that he had resumed his old associations, his
theories had developed fresh vitality and aroused in
him the desire to vindicate them by action.  Since
fate had condemned him to attain financial
prominence slowly, why should he not secure
recognition in the best way he could?  As an alderman
he would be a local power, and once in the arena
of politics and given the opportunity to make
himself felt, why might he not aspire to political
prosperity?
</p>

<p>
He proceeded to seek the nomination.  But he
found that there were other aspirants, and that he
must be stirring.  In Benham the district system
of election was in vogue.  That is, the city was
divided into municipal districts, and each district
chose its own alderman.  In that where Emil lived
the workingman's candidate, so called, was almost
invariably successful against the representative of
the more conservative element of the two wards
concerned, and a nomination was regarded as
equivalent to election.  Now there were two
factions of voters belonging to the dominant party
in the district, one in each ward, and for three
successive years the alderman had come from the
ward other than that in which Emil dwelt.  This
was a plausible argument why the next candidate
should be selected from his ward.  The faction
which Emil hoped to represent contained a
considerable number of Germans with socialistic
affiliations, and it was agreed by a conference of
the rival cliques on the eve of the canvass that
their turn had come to nominate a candidate.
This was fortunate for Emil, as some of the
members of the social debating club to which he
belonged were of this body.  He had already been
prominent at the meetings of the club, prompt and
aggressive in the expression of his opinions on his
feet, and prone to linger over his beer until late
at night agitating the grievances of the under dogs
of industrial competition.  The suggestion of his
name, backed by a vote of his associates, received
respectful consideration from the political
managers, and he at once became a prominent
candidate.  The last three aldermen from the district
had been of Irish extraction, and he was an
American.  His grandfather on his mother's side had
been a German; hence his name Emil.  He was
an undoubted advocate of the rights of the laboring
class, and a foe of capitalistic jobbing.  These
were signal points in his favor.  But the victory
would remain to the aspirant who could obtain a
majority of the delegates to the aldermanic
convention, and the battle would be fought out at the
preliminary caucus where the delegates were
chosen by the voters of the two wards.  Accordingly
the contest became a house-to-house canvass
of the district by the respective candidates, each of
whom had an organization and lieutenants.  There
was speech-making at halls hired for the occasion,
and some treating incident to these rallies.  Poster
pictures of the candidates were requisite for use
in saloons and on bill-boards.  All this demanded
expenditure.  Emil realized presently that, if he
wished to succeed, he could not be niggardly with
his money.  Men would not work for nothing,
and spontaneous enthusiasm was only to be had for
remuneration.  He drew upon his funds, exhausting
the little he had saved the previous year, and
trenching slightly on the mortgage money.  He
hoped to win.  The contest practically was
between him and a German beer manufacturer, who
happened also to be the president of a small bank.
The third candidate was already out of the
running.  Emil in his capacity as tribune of the
people made the most of his opponent's connection
with the moneyed interests.  His satire on this
score offset the advantage which his rival received
from his trade as a brewer, and turned the scale.
On the night of the caucus, the voting booths were
crowded to repletion.  A stream of excited citizens
struggled to the rail to deposit their ballots.
There was imprecation and several resorts to
fisticuffs.  Not until after midnight was the result
known.  Emil won by a liberal margin in both
wards, and his nomination was assured.  He was
escorted home jubilant and beery by a detachment
of his followers, whose cat-calls of triumph thrilled
the listening ears of Constance.  She met him at
the door, and when he was safely inside she threw
her arms about his neck and exclaimed, "Oh, Emil.
I'm so glad!"
</p>

<p>
His small dark eyes were scintillating, his hair
stood up from his brow like a bird's crest, the curl
of his short mustache, odorous of malt, bristled
awry, his speech was thick.
</p>

<p>
"Didn't I tell you they couldn't keep me down?
I shall get now where I belong," he exclaimed as
he strode into the sitting-room and dropped into
a chair with the air of a fuddled but victorious
field-marshal.
</p>

<p>
Constance recognized that he was exhilarated
by drink.  The associations of the last few weeks
had awakened in her vague doubts as to the sort
of influence which the career of an alderman was
likely to exercise upon him.  But she shrank from
harboring criticism.  She yearned to be happy, and
her happiness was to see her husband successful
and prosperous.  So she put away the consciousness
that his breath was tainted, his manner boastful
and jarring, and gave herself up to the joy
which sprang from beholding him a self-satisfied
victor.
</p>

<p>
Emil's self-satisfaction was short lived.  It
chanced that some of the wealthy citizens of
Benham were interested in the establishment of an
electric street-car system for the city and its
suburbs, and were laying their wires to secure the
co-operation of the Board of Aldermen.  The
project had been kept concealed, and not until the
campaign for the city election was well under way
were the machinations of those interested
apparent.  First as an underground rumor, then as a
well-credited report from diverse sources, the news
reached Emil that the nominee of the other party
had the backing of a powerful syndicate.  The
true explanation of this mystery followed, and
with it the statement that Emil's radical utterances
had drawn upon his head the ire of the capitalists
with a mission, who were giving their moral and
financial support in every district to the one of the
two candidates best suited to their necessities
regardless of party.  In place of the walk-over he
had expected, Emil found himself in the midst of
a contest of the fiercest description.  He was
furious, and his exultation was turned to gall.
Why had he not discovered the street-car company
projects in advance and made friends with the
promoters?  This was his first and secret reflection,
which added rancor to his public declaration
that he would bury at the polls the candidate of
these plunderers.  But how?  Where were his
funds to come from?  There had been plenty of
offers of ready money when it was supposed that
his election was assured.  But now the tone of his
supporters was less confident, and ugly rumors
reached him of defections among the Irish in the
other ward.  He was in the fight to stay.  So he
declared on the stump and in his home.  He could
not afford to be defeated.  It was a case of hit or
miss, win or lose.  Maddened, desperate, and
excited, he threw prudence to the winds and
scattered dollars freely for proselytizing expenses
until the morning of the election.  Each side
claimed the victory until the polls were closed.
The result was close&mdash;a matter of one hundred and
fifty ballots&mdash;but Emil proved to be the loser, and
at a cost of over three thousand dollars.  The
fund which he had borrowed from his wife was
exhausted, and he had incurred, besides, a batch
of unpaid bills for refreshments, carriages, and
other incidental expenses.
</p>

<p>
He awoke at dawn from a nap at a table in a
saloon from which the last of his followers had
slipped away.  Slouching into his kitchen, where
his wife was kindling the fire, he tossed his hat on
the table and said with a malignant sneer:
</p>

<p>
"The jig's up."
</p>

<p>
Constance was pale.  She had been watching
for him all night, and had heard from a neighbor
the dismal result.  Her heart was wrung with pity
and distress, but she perceived that it was no time
for consolatory words.  She busied herself in
preparing a cup of coffee, which presently she placed
before him, stooping as she did so to kiss him
softly on the forehead.  He was sitting by the
table with his legs thrust out and his hands sunk
in his trousers pockets, chewing an unlighted cigar,
one of those left from the supply he had bought
for political hospitality.  His wife's action seemed
to remind him of her presence.  He looked up at
her viciously, showing the white of his eye like a
surly dog.
</p>

<p>
"What do you want?"
</p>

<p>
"Your coffee, Emil."
</p>

<p>
He glared at the smoking cup, then with a
sweep of his arm dashed it away:
</p>

<p>
"To hell with you and your messes, you&mdash;you fool!"
</p>

<p>
The crash of the crockery was followed by
silence.  It seemed to Constance that she had been
struck by a bullet, so confounding were his words.
Her husband address her like that?  What did it
mean?
</p>

<p>
"Emil," she gasped&mdash;"you are ill!"
</p>

<p>
"Not ill, but tired of you."
</p>

<p>
"Of me?  Your wife?  What have I done?"
</p>

<p>
"Why didn't you consent to move to New York
when I wished to go?" he snapped.  "If you had,
I wouldn't be in this fix, sold out by a pack of
filthy Hibernian cut-throats."
</p>

<p>
"I was ready to go if you wished it, Emil.  We
will go now&mdash;if only you do not speak to me so
unkindly."
</p>

<p>
"It's too late," he replied with a sneer.  "What
use would it be, anyway?  We look at everything
differently.  We always have."
</p>

<p>
"You do not realize what you are saying.  You
do not know what you are saying."
</p>

<p>
"Crazy, am I?  The best thing for you to do
is to ask some of your church philanthropists to
supply you with laundry work.  You're likely to
need it.  The jig's up, I tell you.  We haven't a
dollar left."
</p>

<p>
"Very well."
</p>

<p>
"The mortgage money with the rest."  He
threw the chewed cigar on the floor and ground it
with his foot.
</p>

<p>
"Very well.  I can bear anything except that
you should speak to me so cruelly.  Have I
been afraid of work?  Whatever has happened
we mustn't forget the children, Emil.  We
must keep up our courage on their account at
least."
</p>

<p>
He scowled at the reference.  "I'll look out for
the children.  Is there any beer in the house?"
</p>

<p>
"No."  Then after a moment's hesitation she
added, "May I ask you something, Emil?  Won't
you give up beer?  It is hurting your life.  I am
sure of it.  I have felt so for some time, and you
have known that I have hated your fondness for
it.  Give it up altogether and&mdash;and we will go to
New York or anywhere you wish and make a fresh
start."
</p>

<p>
In her dismay at his brutality she was eager and
thankful to throw the responsibility for his
conduct on his propensity for drink.  She felt the
obligation to speak fearlessly on this score, even
though she irritated him.  Her gentle remonstrances
had been of no avail, and she must struggle
with him now against himself or lose him
altogether.
</p>

<p>
Emil heard her appeal with a deepening scowl.
For a moment it seemed as though he were about
to strike her.  Then, as what he evidently
considered the audacity of her expostulation worked on
his mind, self-pity was mingled with his anger.
</p>

<p>
"You'd deprive me of my beer, would you?
The only solace I've got.  Why don't you go
smash my fiddle, too?  That's the way with you
pious women; a man gets down on his luck and
you stop his comforts and drive him into the
street.  Very well, then, if I can't get beer in this
house, little saint, there's lots of places I can.  This

<h3>
VI
</h3>

<p>
Constance did not see her husband again
for twenty-four hours.  He returned at
supper-time and took his place at the table
without a word of apology or explanation.  He was
in a state of great depression, morose and
uncommunicative.  On previous occasions when
misfortune had befallen him, he had taken his wife into
his confidence, but now it seemed either that he
had lost his grip on life so completely that words
failed him, or that the resentment which he had
expressed toward her was still dominant.  When
the meal was over, he went out and did not return
until late.  He was boozy with drink, and threw
himself on his bed with the air of a man who
would fain dispel consciousness by the luxury of
sleep.
</p>

<p>
Emil's mode of life for the next few weeks
was substantially a repetition of this programme.
Glum, sour, and listless he went his way in the
morning; fuddled, indifferent, and sleepy he
returned at night.  Concerning his circumstances
and plans he said nothing to Constance.  She was
left totally in the dark as to the extent and the
effect of his reverses.  He had told her that they
were ruined, yet he continued to go down-town as
though nothing had happened.  Trusting that he
would enlighten her of his own accord, at first she
asked no questions.  Then as he did not speak,
she requested him one morning to tell her how his
affairs stood, urging her solicitude and affection.
He listened frowningly and put her off with the
disconcerting utterance "You'll know soon enough.
It's just as well to let a drowning man grasp at
straws while there are any to grasp at."
</p>

<p>
His half-scornful, half-desperate manner forbade
further inquiry at the moment if she did not
wish to widen the breach between them.  Constance
was in deep distress.  She yearned to comfort
and help him, but this wifely, loving impulse
was haunted by the consciousness now forced upon
her with painful clearness that she had misjudged
his nature and was mated to a crank.  How otherwise
could she interpret his hostile attitude toward
herself?  To what but a cross-grained perversity
of soul could she ascribe his disposition to blame
her for his misfortunes?  Her duty was plain, to
make the best of the situation, and to ignore, so
far as self-respect would permit, his laceration of
her feelings, trusting to time to restore his sense
of justice and renew concord between them.  But
what hope was there for the future?  Hope for
the realization of that blissful, ennobling married
state to which she had looked forward as a bride
and had believed in store for her?  Here was the
thought which tormented her and gave poignancy
to the dismay and anxiety of the moment.  Even
if their immediate circumstances were less serious
than Emil had declared, was there any reason to
believe that his next experiment would be more
successful?  She had accepted hitherto without
question his declaration that ill-luck had been
responsible for all his troubles, but that consolation
was hers no longer.  She found herself listening to
the voice of criticism to which until now she had
turned a deaf ear.  In a new spirit, without
bitterness, but in the assertion of her right as a wife
to judge the man to whom she had committed her
happiness, she recalled the incidents of their
married life&mdash;his theories, arguments, and point of
view.  He had declared her to blame for his
misfortunes.  Surely if she had failed in her duty it
had not been toward him.  She had sacrificed her
opinions to his, and for his sake abnegated her
most precious predilections in order to make the
union of their lives sweeter and more complete.  If
she were guilty, was it not of treason to her own
instincts and her own conscience?
</p>

<p>
Emil indeed had persuaded himself not merely
that fortune had betrayed him, and the hand of
the prosperous world was against him, but that
his wife was partly to blame for it.  Looking back
on his last fiasco, he conjured up the circumstance
that she had not fallen in with his suggestion of
an exodus to New York, and this he had promptly
distorted into a grievance, which grew the more
he nursed it.  To the notion that she had thwarted
him in everything and that their relations as
husband and wife had been wholly unsympathetic
was only another step.  It suited him to feel that
he was the injured party, for he was face to face
with the responsibility of supporting his family,
which must be met or avoided.  The question of
immediate funds was already pressing.  His last
reverse had discouraged and angered him, but it
had not diminished his confidence that he would
succeed in the right place.  It had only convinced
him that Benham was not the right place; that
Benham was too small and provincial; too
unappreciative of real ability.  He was unpleasantly
in debt, but the bills which he had contracted for
political expenses could be disregarded for the
present.  He had no property with which to meet
them, and if he were pressed, he had merely to go
into insolvency in order to rid himself of them
altogether.  Nor need he worry about the
mortgage for the present.  It would not be due for
two years, and, provided the interest were paid,
they could not be molested.  These redeeming
features of his plight were clear to him after the
first days of mental agitation, but his spirit did
not reassert its wonted elasticity.  Analyzing the
cause, he perceived that his whole surroundings
were repugnant to him, and that he shrank from
recommencing life at the foot of the ladder under
the conditions in which he found himself.  He
was determined to leave Benham, and he was
determined that his family, if they came with him,
should toe the mark.  What this phrase meant
precisely he did not formulate, but it suited his
mood.  "Toe the mark."  He kept repeating it
to himself, as though it promised relief from
domestic insubordination.  Yes, if his wife did not
choose to adopt his theories and abet him in his
undertakings, she could go her own way for all
he cared.  It was only on account of the children
that he did not put an end to their contract of
marriage to-morrow by leaving her.  Except for them
it were surely folly for a man and woman whose
ideas were utterly at variance to continue a
partnership the only fruit of which could be discord
and recriminations.  So he argued, and it was only
the thought of his children which restrained him
from precipitate action and caused him to
continue to go down-town every day seeking a bare
livelihood.  Since the night of his defeat at the
polls, Constance had not asked him for money.
Presumably she had some laid by, and was living
on that, but by the first of the month she must
have recourse to him or starve, and then would be
the time for his ultimatum.  The terms of this,
beyond a declaration of general discontent, were
still hazy in his brain, befogged by malt liquor
and inflamed by hatred of the world, but a glowing
conviction that their marriage had been a failure
through her fault was a satisfactory substitute
for definiteness.  Brooding like a spider in its web,
secretive, hoping that something would turn up to
put him on his feet again, yet almost reckless in
his attitude, and drinking assiduously, he drifted
on without aim.  His evenings were spent at his
workingmen's club, where he continued as an outlet
to his feelings to deliver virulent philippics,
which he realized as he uttered them were a sorry
equivalent for personal success.
</p>

<p>
While thus limp and embittered, a final mishap
impelled Emil to action.  It happened that the
broker on the same floor as the office where he
had desk-room, and with whom he was on familiar
terms, let him in for a disastrous tip and put the
screws on when the market went the other way.
The sum involved was three hundred dollars, the
total residue of Emil's capital, which he had
allowed to remain untouched with this false friend
in order not to be entirely without the means to
speculate.  The advice offered had seemed to be
friendly and disinterested.  When the result proved
disastrous the victim promptly suspected guile.
Certainly he encountered a flinty demeanor, as
though the proprietor of the "bucket-shop" were
cognizant of the impecuniosity of his customer
and had decided to squeeze him dry and break
with him.  This from the man whose social status
on the street he had championed seemed to Emil
rank ingratitude.  Yet the broker was making no
more than ordinary business demands upon him.
His margin was exhausted, and the transaction
would be closed unless he supplied additional
security.  This was business-like, but not friendly, as
it seemed to Emil, especially as the ingrate, who
had been so confident of the value of the tip, chose
now to be sphinx-like as to what the next day's
price of the stock would be.  All he would vouchsafe
was that it would go up sooner or later.
</p>

<p>
Since it was necessary to act at once, and to sell
meant the loss of the remnant of his capital, Emil
concluded to give himself a chance by making use
of five hundred dollars which had just been paid
over to him for a client in redemption of a
mortgage.  He argued that the stock, having fallen in
price contrary to expectation, was not likely to
decline further at once, and that if he protected
his account, he would be able to make inquiries
and form a more intelligent opinion by the end
of a few days as to what he had best do.  Besides,
there was lurking in his mind the bitter argument,
which he chose to believe sound, that the world
owed every man a living, and assuredly owed it
to a man like himself.  Since the hand of society
seemed to be against him, why should he not take
advantage of the resources at his disposal and save
himself?  He was simply borrowing; if he were
not able to return the money at once, he would do
so later with interest.  The consequences of this
performance were disastrous.  As Emil had predicted,
the stock in question remained stationary
for three days, but by the end of them he felt no
clearer regarding which course to pursue.  Estimates
as to its value were contradictory; yet since
a sale at the market price meant the safety of the
five hundred dollars at the cost of his own financial
obliteration, he remained hopeful.  On the fourth
day the stock broke sharply, and again on the day
after.  His holding was only one hundred shares&mdash;a
paltry transaction from a capitalistic point of
view&mdash;yet it was rashness for him.  Adversity
and his pressing needs had tempted him to
disregard his meditated prudence and to venture on
thin ice.  He perceived himself ruined and a
defaulter.  The obliquity of his peculation was
mitigated in his mind by the conviction that
fortune had been signally cruel to him.  As for the
borrowed money, he would give his note and pay
it presently when he was on his feet again.  Yet
he appreciated that his opportunities for making
a living in Benham were at an end, and that if he
remained, he might find difficulty in inducing the
owner of the five hundred dollars to accept him
as a creditor without demur.  Clearly the simplest
course was to come to terms by post.  To shake
the dust of Benham from his feet was his dearest
wish, and the time had arrived for its fulfilment.
There was still one hundred dollars belonging to
his client in his hands which he had not used.
This he drew to provide himself with travelling
expenses, arguing that the sooner he were able to
reach New York, the quicker the loan would be
repaid, and slipped from the city without a word
to anyone.  He had decided to cut adrift from all
his past associations, and an indispensable portion
of his plan was to sever forever his relations with
his wife.
</p>

<p>
A week later he wrote this letter to her from
New York:
</p>


<p class="letter">
Constance:
</p>

<p class="letter">
This is to let you know what has become of me.  You may
have guessed the truth, but it's woman's way to worry, weep,
and raise a hue and cry, though she knows in her heart that she's
mismated, and that it would be a godsend to her if "hubby"
had really blown his brains out or were safely at the bottom of
a well.  I'm not dead yet, nor am I contemplating suicide at
present.  Though if the time ever does come when I think the
game is played out, it will be one-two-three-go! without any
pause between the numbers.  But I'm as good as dead now, so
far as you are concerned.  You won't be troubled by me further.
You've seen the last of me.  I told you I was strapped.  I'm
cleaned out to the last dollar.  But that doesn't phaze me except
for the moment.  I'm going to make a fresh start and a clean
sweep at the same time.  You know as well as I that our marriage
has not been a glittering success.  In short, we've made a
mess of it.  We thought we were suited to each other, and we
find we're not.  That's all.  I don't approve of you any more
than you do of me, and what's the use of making each other
miserable by protracting the relation until death do us part?  It's
up to me to undo the Gordian-knot, and I've cut it.
</p>

<p class="letter">
You'll shed some tears, I suppose, over the situation, and
your friends will call me a brute.  But when the shock is past
and sentimental considerations have evaporated, just ask yourself
if I'm not doing the sensible thing for us both.  We don't look
at life in the same way and never will.  I'm a radical, and
you're a conservative, and we were misled before marriage by
the affinities of flesh to suppose that oil and water would
harmonize.  From the point of view of law I'm the offending party,
and you'll be a free woman to sue for divorce on the ground of
desertion, by the end of three years.  In the meantime, you
can go back to your kindergarten work or whatever you see fit.
You have your health, and your philanthropic church friends
will enable you to support yourself.
</p>

<p class="letter">
The only hitch is the children.  If you had been ready to
follow me to New York when I first suggested it, we might not
be separating now.  I expect and am anxious to provide for
them.  If you will send them on to me, they shall want for
nothing.  But if you are bent on keeping them, as I foresee
may be the case, the responsibility is yours.  I should like one
at least&mdash;preferably the boy.  If you insist on keeping them
both, I can't help myself.  There's where you have the whip-hand
over me.  But don't delude yourself with the notion that
I don't love my own flesh and blood because I'm not willing to
live with their mother.
</p>

<p class="letter">
There will be no use in your coming on here or trying to
find me.  I have made up my mind.  We could never be happy
together, so the fewer words said about parting the better.  Send
your answer regarding the children to the New York post-office.
I shall expect it for a week.  The money you loaned me is gone
with the rest, but they can't turn you out of your house until
the mortgage is due, if you pay the interest.  Some day I shall
pay it back to you.  I wish you well, and consider I'm doing
us both a service in cutting loose from you.
</p>

<p class="letter">
Good-by, EMIL.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It seemed to Constance when she had finished
this letter as though her heart would stop.  Was
this reality?  Could it be that her husband was
abandoning her and her children in cold blood,
treating the sacred ties of marriage as lightly as
though they were straws?  Alas!  his cruel words
stared her in the face, freezing her soul, which had
been sick for days over his unexplained absence;
sick from dread.  Yes, she had guessed; but she
had put the horror from her as impossible, despite
his hints.  Unbalanced and embittered as he was,
he could not be so unkind.  Now she was face to
face with certainty; there was no room for hope.
It was true; so cruelly inhumanly true that her
brain felt dazed and numb.  She gazed at his
writing stony-eyed and appalled, limp with dismay and
forlornness.  To avoid falling she put out her
hand to the table, and the contact of her own flesh
served to readjust her consciousness.  Seating
herself she swept her fingers across her brow to rally
her senses, and read the letter again slowly.  Then
mortification succeeded dismay, and resentment
followed close on mortification.  The wounded
pride of the wife, the indignation of the mother
protesting for her children asserted themselves,
causing her to flush to the roots of her hair and her
pulses to tingle.  Coward!  Unnatural father!
What had she done to deserve this?  What had
they done, helpless innocents?  Give them up to
him?  Her children, now the only joy of her life?
Never.  They could not both have them.  Why
should he who had left them in the lurch have
either?  She could hear their prattle in the
adjoining room, poor little souls, unconscious of their
misery.  Then her sense of wounded pride and her
anger were forgotten in the agony of a possible
separation from her offspring, and in the loss of
her husband's love, and her tense nerves gave way.
"Oh, Emil, my husband, how could you?" she
moaned, and burying her face in her hands she let
sorrow have full sway.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-080"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-080.jpg" alt="&quot;Oh, Emil, my husband, how could you?&quot; she moaned" />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Emil, my husband, how could you?&quot; she moaned
</p>

<p>
When she had dried her eyes she was prepared
to face the situation and to think more calmly.
Certain points were now clear.  Emil was right;
since he had ceased to love her, they could never
be happy together.  So far as she could see, she
had not been at fault, though he had persuaded
himself that she was to blame.  She would never
have left him; but now that he had deserted her,
she could dare to admit that their souls were not
in accord, and that her love and respect for him
had been waning in spite of herself for many
months.  She would not attempt to follow him,
and she desired to retain both the children.  Was
it her duty to let Emil have one of them?  Here
was the only harassing point in the plans for the
future which she was formulating.  Would it be
fair to the children to separate them?  Would she
be justified in keeping them both, in view of the
affection which their father had professed for his
own flesh and blood?  As Emil had declared, he
and she had made a mess of their marriage, and
they were to separate.  Was it fair to him to keep
both the boy and the girl?  Ah, but she could not
bear the thought of giving up either.  She felt the
need of counsel.  To whom could she turn?  Who
were her friends?  She thought of Mr. Prentiss,
and she remembered her husband's taunt concerning
her philanthropic church friends with a sense
of shrinking.  The church offered itself as a refuge
to all in the hour of distress, but it seemed to her
as though she would rather starve than apply to
Mr. Prentiss.  Not that she was afraid of starving.
That side of the situation had no terrors for
her.  She was almost glad at the idea of supporting
herself and her darlings, and she had entire
confidence in her ability to do so, even though she
were forced to scrub floors.  But she yearned for
the sympathy and advice of a friend.  How lonely
she had suddenly become in this large, busy city!
Emil had evinced little desire, especially of late,
to make friends in the neighborhood, and she had
been so absorbed in her home and her husband's
interest that she had disregarded her social
opportunities.  He had been apt to speak slightingly of
their acquaintances as people whom he would soon
outstrip in the struggle of life.  And now she was
the poorest of the poor, the saddest of the sad, one
of the lowly common people for whom her doctor
father's heart had ever cherished fond and
patient sympathy.  She was one of them now
herself.  How different had been her dreams
and her ambition.  To think that she, Constance
Forbes, had come to this&mdash;a wife abandoned by
her husband, alone and friendless, with only the
semblance of a roof to shelter her and her
children.  But all this was nothing if only she need
not part with either of her babies.  She would be
able to support them, never fear, and with them
to support she could be brave, even happy.  But
without them?  No, no, Emil had forsaken her,
she had lost her faith in him, he was not worthy
of the sacrifice; she dared not trust him; he had
no right to either.  She could not, she would not
let either go.
</p>

<p>
When the morning came she was more firmly of
the same opinion, and she composed this reply to
her husband:
</p>

<p class="letter">
Emil:
</p>

<p class="letter">
I have your letter and my heart is filled with sorrow.  I
cannot compel you to live with me against your will.  God knows
I have tried to be a loving, dutiful, and sympathetic wife, but it
seems I have failed to please you.  It is true that our ideas of
how to live and what is right are very different.  I have been
aware of that in my secret soul, but for your sake I did my best
to adopt your point of view.  Now I shall be free to follow my
own.  Since you no longer love me, I am not sorry that we are
to live apart, for I can see now that I have suffered much on
your account.  But I do not choose to reproach you.  What
good would it do?  Besides you are the father of my children&mdash;poor
little things.  I do not think that I should have written to
you at all if it were not for the question what is to become of
them.
</p>

<p class="letter">
I am trying to do what is best for them and to be just; just
to you and to myself.  I have decided to keep both the children.
They are babies still, and need a mother's love.  A father's too,
but it seems they cannot have both.  Let God judge between
us, Emil.  They are my flesh and blood too, and it is you who
are forsaking us, not we you.  As you say, I have my health
and we shall not starve.  I am not afraid.  There is nothing
more to say, is there?  It has all been a dreadful mistake&mdash;and
we thought we should be so happy.  Good-by.  In spite of
everything I shall always think of you kindly.
</p>

<p class="letter">
CONSTANCE.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Having despatched this she felt as though she
would be glad to die.  Life seemed so flat, and her
condition so humiliating.  Her love for Emil was
dead; the union of their souls was broken; what
was there to look forward to?  Yet she knew that
she must not stop to repine or to indulge in
self-pity.  The stern necessity of winning bread for
her children confronted her and must be faced at
once and resolutely.  In this she must find happiness
and fresh inspiration.  It was her duty to
close the ears and eyes of her soul to the voices and
visions of the past.  Hard work would save her
brain from giving way, and hard work only.
What should that work be?  What was she to
do?  In the first glow of her pride, revolting
at the slight which her husband had put upon
her, the way had seemed easy, but viewed in the
sober light of reality it bristled with difficulties.
Yet now, as she pondered and realized what
failure would mean, her spirit rose to meet them,
and immediate needs forced sorrow to the background.
</p>

<p>
Where was she to find work?  Since the receipt
of her husband's letter everything outside her own
emotions had been a blank to her; her gaze had
been solely introspective.  Conscious now of the
need of action and of renewing her contact with
the world, she took up the newspaper, yesterday's
issue of which lay unopened on the table, and
began to examine the page of advertisements for
employment.  She must find at once something
which would provide her with ready money.  Only
through friends and only after delay could she
hope to obtain a kindergarten position; it would
take time and instruction to learn typewriting; she
was not sufficiently proficient in languages or music
to offer herself as a teacher.  She could become a
domestic servant or a shopgirl.  In the former case
it would be necessary to board out her children,
to give them to some institution, perhaps, a
prospect which wrung her heart; in the latter she could
be with them at night, but who would look after
and guard them during the day?  What did other
women do whose husbands ran away and left
them?  The long list of people out of work was
appalling, and few of the opportunities offered
seemed to fit her circumstances.  Someone was
seeking employment as a seamstress.  She might
take in sewing.  This perhaps was the most
feasible suggestion.  She was handy at plain sewing,
and a little practice would doubtless render her
skilful.  Yes, she would try this, and in order to
obtain a start would solicit work from some of the
neighbors, if needs be.  The neighbors?  They
did not know as yet of her misfortune&mdash;her
disgrace, for it was a disgrace to be forsaken by her
husband.  It would be necessary to tell them.
What should she say?  Entertaining sadly this
necessity of an avowal, she glanced over the rest
of the newspaper, and came suddenly upon a
paragraph which informed her that her misfortune was
already public.  Prefaced by offensive headlines,
"Emil Stuart disappears from Benham!  What
has become of Mrs. Morgan's mortgage money?"
the wretched story stood exploited to the world.
Constance read and the cup of her distress and
humiliation overflowed.  It needed only this
insinuation of dishonesty to complete her misery.
Her husband an embezzler?  Where should she
hide her head?  Nor was there comfort in the
reporter's closing effort at euphemism: "One or two
acquaintances of the late candidate for aldermanic
honors, when apprised of his mysterious disappearance,
expressed the belief that his seeming irregularities
would be explained to the satisfaction of
all concerned; but a gentleman, whose name we
are not at liberty to disclose, hazards an opinion,
based on personal observation, that Mr. Stuart has
been premeditating this step for several weeks, and
is a fugitive from justice.  The circumstance that
his wife and two children have been left behind
in Benham invites the further inquiry whether he
has also abandoned his family.  There are rumors
that Mr. Stuart's domestic relations were not
altogether harmonious."
</p>

<p>
Constance let the newspaper slip from her
hands.  Her cheeks burned with shame.  This was
the last straw.  Her husband a defaulter, and her
relations with him the subject of common newspaper
gossip.  As she stood spell-bound by this
new phase of misfortune the door-bell rang.  A
visitor.  Who could it be?  Some sympathetic or
curious neighbor who had read of her calamities.
Or more probably the writer of the newspaper
article coming to probe into her misery in search
of fresh copy.  For a moment she thought that she
would not answer the call, and she waited hoping
that whoever it was would go away.  Again the
bell rang, this time sharply.  It might be
something important, even a telegram from Emil to
clear himself.  Picking up the newspaper she concealed
it hastily, then stepped into the passage and
opened the door slightly.
</p>

<p>
"May I come in?" asked a strong, friendly voice.
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, Mr. Prentiss; excuse me," she faltered.
She had recognized at once who her visitor was,
but so many bewildering things had happened that
she stood for a moment irresolute, refusing to
credit her own senses.  As she opened wide the
door, the clergyman strode in fearlessly as though
he realized that the situation must be carried by
storm.  Entering the parlor, he put out his hand
and said with manly effusion:
</p>

<p>
"I have come to ask you to let me help you, Mrs. Stuart."
</p>

<p>
"Sit down, please.  You are very kind.  I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Her words choked her, and she stopped.
</p>

<p>
"I saw by the newspaper yesterday that you
were in trouble.  I do not wish to pry into your
affairs, but I thought that you might be glad of
the counsel of a friend."
</p>

<p>
His visit was precious balm to her spirit, but,
despite her gratitude, the knowledge that he was
heaping the traditional coals of fire on her head
made her uncomfortable.  She had choked from
mingled relief and mortification.  But now her
finer instinct responded to the kindness of his words
and she said with simple directness: "I should like
to tell you everything, Mr. Prentiss.  My husband
left a week ago.  He does not intend to return.
I have a letter from him, and he&mdash;he does not wish
to live with me any longer.  He was willing to
support the children, but I could not make up my
mind to let them go.  Our money is all gone and
this house is mortgaged.  If you will help me to
find work so that I can support them and myself,
I shall be very grateful.  It was very good of you
to come to see me."
</p>

<p>
The children, attracted by the voice of a
stranger, had run in and stood one on either side
of their mother staring at him shyly with cherubic
eyes.  The clergyman said to himself that here
was a veritable Madonna of distress&mdash;this lithe,
nervous-looking woman with her slim figure and
soulful face.  How pretty and neat she looked in
spite of her misery!  How engaging were the tones
in which she had set forth her calamity!  He had
always admired her, and it had been a disappointment
to him that she had strayed.  There was almost
jubilation in his heart as he heard that she
was free from the wretch who had pulled her
down; and though he intended to temper the ardor
of the priest by the tact of a man of the world, he
could not entirely restrain his impulse to stigmatize
her husband.  "I see," he said.  "You are much
to be pitied.  It is a cruel wrong; the act of a
coward.  But you must not take your trouble too
much to heart, Mrs. Stuart, for the man who will
leave a sweet wife and tender children from mere
caprice is no real husband and father."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Stuart has had much to worry him of late.
He has lost money, and been unfortunate in
politics."  Her impulse was to apologize for her
husband even then.  "I cannot understand though
how he could leave us," she added.  After all why
should she a second time on Emil's account set her
face against the truth in the presence of this true
friend?  Emil was a coward, and his act was a
cruel wrong.
</p>

<p>
But Mr. Prentiss had recovered his aplomb.  "I
will not distress you by talking about him; he has
gone.  The matter with which I am concerned is
how to help you.  We must find you employment
at once."
</p>

<p>
Constance regarded him gratefully.  "That is
my great requirement just now, Mr. Prentiss.  I
need work to keep my children from starving and
to help me to forget.  I am not afraid of work.
I shall be glad to do anything for which I am fit."
</p>

<p>
"I understand, I understand.  It is the pride of
my church to help just such women as you to
help themselves.  You need give yourself no concern
as to your immediate pecuniary needs.  They will
be provided for.  I will send the Deaconess to you
at once."
</p>

<p>
The directness of his bounty, the plain intimation
that she was a subject for charity brought a
flush to her cheeks.  But she knew in an instant
that it would be false pride to protest.  There was
no food or money in the house.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," she said simply.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Prentiss divined her reluctance and appreciated
the delicacy of her submission.  He recognized
that this woman with wistful brown eyes and
nervous, intelligent face was no ordinary person&mdash;was
even more deserving than he had supposed,
and his thoughts were already busy with the
problem of her future.  He must find just the right
thing for her.  "I know, of course, that you wish
to become self-supporting as soon as possible," he
said.  "Will you tell me a little more about
yourself and your capabilities?  You came to Benham
a few months before your marriage to fit yourself
to be a kindergarten teacher, if I remember
aright?"
</p>

<p>
During the momentary pause which preceded
this inquiry her conscience had been reasserting
itself.  She had longed for counsel and here it was.
If she had erred, there was yet time to repair her
fault.  "Before we talk of that, may I ask you
one question, Mr. Prentiss?  I wish to know if you
think it was selfish of me to keep both the children.
I desire to do what is right this time, whatever it
cost me."  She clasped her hands resolutely in her
lap as though she were nerving herself for a
sacrifice.  "I hope you will tell me exactly what you
think."
</p>

<p>
The clergyman's heart warmed at this revelation
of spiritual vigor.  "Here is a soul worth helping,"
he reflected.  Then, in answer to her appeal,
he exclaimed with righteous emphasis: "Ask your
own heart, my dear woman.  Would you dare
trust these babies to your husband's keeping?  This
is a problem of right and wrong, and demands a
severing of the sheep from the goats.  You may
banish that doubt forever."
</p>

<p>
Constance dropped her eyes to hide the tears
of satisfaction which had sprung into them at his
words.  Her children were safe.  The counsel
given was the very echo of the test by which she
had justified herself toward Emil.  "Excuse me,"
she said in apology for her emotion.  Then
looking up she added with tremulous brightness, "I
felt that I must be sure before anything else was
decided.  And now to answer your question as to
my own capabilities: I have none.  I am eager to
learn, and I have had some education&mdash;my father
was fond of books and had a library&mdash;but I tell
you frankly that there is nothing but the simplest
manual work for which I am fitted at the present
time.  I have thought that all over."
</p>

<p>
"So far so good.  Much of the trouble of this
world proceeds from the inability of people to
discern for what they are not fitted.  Can you
sew?"
</p>

<p>
"I can do plain sewing satisfactorily."
</p>

<p>
"We will begin with that then.  It will keep you
busy for the time being.  Meanwhile I shall have
an opportunity to consider what you had best
undertake."  He rose and put out his hand with
spontaneous friendliness.  "Good-by.  God bless
you.  You are a brave soul, and He will not desert
you or leave you comfortless."
</p>

<p>
Constance quickened at the firm pressure, and
her own fingers acknowledged the interest which
it expressed.  She looked into his eyes with frank
confidence.  "You have come to me at a time when
I needed someone more than ever before in my life.
I shall never forget it."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Prentiss nodded and turned to go as though
he would disclaim this expression of everlasting
obligation.  He felt that he was about his Master's
business, and was seeking neither thanks nor praise.
Yet, while he deprecated her gratitude, her entire
mental attitude caused him ethical and æsthetic
satisfaction.  The conviction that this ward of the
church was worth saving and helping gave elasticity
to his step and erectness to his large figure
as he strode up the street, knocking now and again
some bit of orange peel or other refuse from the
sidewalk with a sweep of his cane, which suggested
a spirit eager to do battle in behalf of righteousness.

VII
</h3>

<p>
Two days later the Rev. George Prentiss
dined at the house of another of his
parishioners, Mrs. Randolph Wilson.  She was a
widow of about forty-five, the sister of Carleton
Howard, reputedly the wealthiest and most sagacious
of Benham's financial magnates, and a generous
benefactress of St. Stephen's.  Her bounty had
enabled the rector from time to time to carry out
his cherished plans for the æsthetic adornment of
the church property.  The reredos, two stained-glass
windows, and the baptismal font in the
enlarged edifice had been provided by her; and
in the matter of charity she never failed to respond
by munificent subscriptions to the various causes
in aid of which he appealed to his congregation.
They were friends and allies; interested mutually
in St. Stephen's, and interested also, as they both
liked to feel, in promoting American civilization
outside of church work.  Her house, or palace, as
it should more properly be termed, a counterpart
to that of her brother's which adjoined it, stood
in the van of progress, in Benham's fashionable
new quarter beyond the River Drive.  No pains
or expense had been spared to make these mansions
impressive and magnificent.  Architects of repute
had been employed to superintend their construction,
and their decorations and furnishings had
been chosen in consultation with persons whose
business it was to know the whereabouts of admirable
objects of art, and to tempt impecunious noble
families abroad to exchange their unique treasures
for dazzling round sums of American gold.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson could fairly be termed the leader
of social activity in Benham, if such a term be
compatible with the institutions of a country where
every women is supposed to be a law unto herself.
Fashions, in the narrow sense of clothes, are in
America set by the dressmakers, but what
Mrs. Wilson wore was always a matter of moment to
women who wished to be in style.  She dressed
elegantly, and she was able to take liberties with
the dressmakers, doing daring things with colors
and materials which justified themselves, yet were
so individual that they were liable to make guys
of those who copied her.  Consequently, her wardrobe
had a distinction of its own which proclaimed
fashion yet defied it.  Yet her clothes, striking and
superb as they often were, constituted only a small
part of her social effectiveness.  Her gracious
finished manners, and quick, tactful intelligence were
the agents of a spirit perpetually eager to be
occupied and to lead, and which had found a labor of
love in directing what may well be called Benham's
æsthetic renaissance.
</p>

<p>
For Benham's evolution had been no mere
growth of bricks and mortar, and no mere triumph
in census figures over other centres of population.
Even more remarkable and swift than its physical
changes had been the transformation in the point
of view of its citizens.  Twenty years earlier&mdash;in
1870, when Mr. Prentiss was a young man just
starting in the ministry&mdash;he had been one of a
small group of earnest souls interested in awakening
the public to a consciousness of the paucity of
their æsthetic interests, and to the value of color
as a stimulating factor in the every-day life of the
community, and as such he had often deplored the
aridity of Benham's point of view.  In those days
the city was virtually a hot-bed of republican
simplicity and contempt for social refinements so far
as all but a very small percentage of the
inhabitants was concerned.  Those who built houses
larger and finer than their neighbors were few in
number and were stigmatized, if not as enemies
of the institutions of the country, as purse-proud
and frivolous.  Hotels were conducted on the
theory that what was good enough for the landlord
was good enough for the guest, and that malcontents
could go elsewhere.  In matters appertaining
to art, hygiene, education or municipal management,
one man's opinion was regarded as equal to
any other's, provided he could get the job.  Special
knowledge was sneered at, and the best patriots in
the public estimation were those who did not
distrust the ability of the average citizen to produce
masterpieces in the line of his or her employment
by dint of raw genius untrammelled or unpolluted
by the experience of older civilizations.  Though
solid business men wore solemn-looking black
frock-coats and black wisp ties in business hours, to
dress again in the evening was looked at askance as
undemocratic.  It would have been considered an
invasion of the rights of the free-born citizen to
forbid expectoration in the street cars.  Suggestions
that the vicious and unregenerate adult pauper
poor should not be herded with the young, that
busy physicians should cleanse a lancet before
probing a wound, and that sewage should not be
emptied into a river used as a source of water
supply, were still sniffed at by those in charge of
public affairs as aristocratic innovations unworthy
the attention of a sovereign people.  Architectural
beauty both within and without the house was
disregarded in favor of monotonous sober hues and
solid effects, which were deemed to be suggestive
of the seriousness of the national character.
</p>

<p>
While deploring some of these civic manifestations,
Mr. Prentiss had appreciated that the basis
of this æsthetic sterility was ethical.  When less
discerning persons had attributed it solely to
ignorance and self-righteous superficiality he had
maintained that a puritanical, yet moral and
sincere, hostility to extravagance and display was
responsible for the preference for ugly architecture
and homely upholstery and decoration, and
that conscience was the most formidable obstacle
to progress.  As a priest of a church which
fostered beauty and favored rational enjoyment
of the fruits of the earth, he had never
sympathized with this public attitude, but he had
understood and, as an American, respected it.
</p>

<p>
Now, in the twinkling of an eye, as it were, all
was changed, and Benham was in the throes of a
revival; a revival which during the last ten years
had revolutionized Benham's architecture and
Benham's point of view.  The public had become
possessed by the conviction that they had
outgrown their associations and that the standards
hitherto revered were out of date and unworthy
of a nation and a city pledged to enlighten the
world, upon whom prosperity had been bestowed
in large measure.  The group of earnest souls
who had dared to criticise seemed suddenly to have
become a phalanx&mdash;numerically unimportant, still,
when compared with the whole population, that
seething army of industrial wage-earners&mdash;but
assertive and energetic out of proportion to their
numbers.  The city had become a hive of reforming
activities.  Specialists in the arts and humanities
were no longer classed as traitors, but were
welcomed by a growing clientage as safeguards
against bumptious individualism.  Though a cheerful
optimism in regard to the city's architectural
merits still prevailed at large, a silent censorship
was at work; substituting, in the business quarter,
new mammoth structures adapted to modern
industrial needs, erecting in the fashionable quarter,
by the aid of American architects trained in Paris,
well-built and individual-looking residences.
Instead of three or four cheerless, barrack-like
caravansaries with sodden cookery, there was a
score of modern hotels, the proprietors of which
vied with one another in their endeavors to lure
patronage by costly and sumptuous innovations.
There were comfortable and inviting restaurants.
The slap-dash luncheon counter, with its display
of pallid pie and one cadaverous chicken, was
waning in the popular esteem, in favor of neat spas,
at which the rush of patronage was alleviated by
clean service and wholesome fare.  There were
eight theatres, each more spacious and splendid
than its predecessor.  A frowsy black coat, worn
in the forenoon, had ceased to be a badge of
patriotism or moral worth, and the community had
become alive to the values of spruceness, color,
and comfort in matters of dress.  Not only this,
but on the streets of Benham there were many
stylish equipages with liveried grooms, and in the
superb homes which the wealthy citizens had
established, there were grand entertainments,
where rivalry was rampant and money flowed like
champagne.  And last, but not least, there was
Mrs. Randolph Wilson, the quintessence in her
own person of all that was best in this revival in
favor of the beautiful things of life, the living
embodiment of this newly directed and freshly
inspired energy.  For well-to-do Benham and
Mr. Prentiss liked to believe that the impulse behind
these materialistic manifestations was conscience
and aspiration, a reaching out for a greater human
happiness and a wider human usefulness than had
been possible under the old dispensation.  This
access of lavish philanthropy and study of
charitable methods, this zeal of committees promoting
new and more thorough methods in hygiene and
education, and all the phases of this new awakening
in quest of Christian beauty signified to him
Benham's&mdash;and hence American&mdash;originality and
fervor refined and spiritualized; Benham's
enterprise and independence informed, chastened, and
fortified.
</p>

<p>
And yet there was another side to this whole
matter which had haunted Mr. Prentiss much of
late, and which was in his thoughts to-night as he
sat smoking his cigar after dinner.  He had dined
sumptuously.  Cool oysters, soup of mushrooms,
fish smothered in a luscious sauce, cutlets of
venison with French beans, little pyramids of <i>paté de
foie gras</i> encased in jelly, butter-ball ducks with a
salad richly dressed, and a confection of fruit,
cream, and pastry, which was evidently a
gastronomic specialty of Mrs. Wilson's French cook.
He had tasted everything; he had drunk two
glasses of champagne, and been pleasantly aware
that the cup of black coffee, served after dinner,
was an entrancing concoction which his own kitchen
did not afford; and he felt that his repast had done
him good.  It was for him an occasion.  Obviously
it was for Mrs. Wilson an every-day affair.  Moreover,
this rich, delicious dinner, served by noiseless
servants on choice china, was in harmony with the
rest of the magnificent establishment, in harmony
with the artistic scheme of color, the soft lustrous
draperies, the striking pictures and other masterpieces
of art purchased for large sums abroad, and
Mrs. Wilson's beautiful toilette and exquisite
personality.  Here was luxury triumphant and
compelling, yet unappeased and seeking fresh
opportunities for æsthetic delight; as witness a Millet,
an inlaid table, and a Japanese idol in the room
in which he sat, all new since he had dined there last.
</p>

<p>
What a vivid contrast all this to the cheerless
often squalid homes which he was accustomed to
visit as a rector of Christ's church!  The thought
which haunted him was that one result of the city's
marvellous growth and development had been the
accentuation of the distinctions between rich and
poor, between class and class in a community
where, until lately, there had been theoretically no
classes.  To be sure he had Mr. Carleton
Howard's assertion that there was no country in
the world where the poor man was so well off.
This was very likely true, but it did not affect the
proposition that the rich were daily growing richer
and more self-indulgent.  What was to be the
limit&mdash;the outcome of this renaissance of beauty
and comfort, which he had welcomed?  Had not
the æsthetic reaction almost reached the point
where, both as a priest of God and as a good
American, it behooved him to cry halt against
luxury and extravagance?  He frowned at this
last reflection for the reason that he was painfully
aware that he had fulminated against this sort of
thing from the pulpit for years, formerly as part
of the clerical formula championing the cause of
the spirit against the flesh, and latterly because
the Aladdin-like growth of great fortunes all over
the land, and conspicuously in his own community,
had often suggested the comparison between the
passage of a camel through the eye of a needle and
the rich man's entrance into the kingdom of heaven
as an appropriate text.  He had spoken with fervor
and sincerity concerning the responsibilities of
those having great possessions, and sometimes with
living pictures in his mind.  Neither Mrs. Wilson
nor her brother had ever been among those for
whom these admonitions were intended.  They
had opened their purse-strings liberally to every
meritorious cause.  The goodly size of their
cheques was to him a constant source both of
satisfaction and astonishment&mdash;astonishment at the
new possibilities open to those interested in God's
kingdom.
</p>

<p>
Yet, though he put from him as ungenerous and
unnecessary any positive criticism of his hostess,
in the teeth of her many benefactions and her
personal activity in social undertakings, he could
not help realizing that, in spite of his utterances,
the evil which he deprecated was proceeding at a
pace which suggested the course of wild-fire.  And
the worst of it was that he&mdash;the church&mdash;was so
helpless.  Great fortunes had been accumulated
with a zeal which suggested the inevitable march
of destiny&mdash;a law which seemed almost to mock
the spirit of Christ&mdash;and, even while he was
musing, the city had become a theatre of industrial
contrasts, with the pomp and pride of life in the
centre of the stage and poverty and distress in the
ample background.  There recurred to him the
traditional image of the curate of his faith&mdash;the
Church of England&mdash;cringing before or patronized
by the titled worshippers of Mammon.  This,
at least, he could resent as impossible in his
case&mdash;he had never hesitated to speak his mind to any
of his parishioners, however important&mdash;still, the
reminder was disconcerting and a challenge to his
conscience.  Nor was the reflection that this wave
of luxury, this more and more exacting reverence
for material comforts, was a part of the movement
of the century, and was common to all civilized
countries, a solace.  He was an American, but first
of all, he was a servant of the church, and the
church was the beacon of civilization.  Was she
doing her work, if these terrible inequalities were
to continue?  What was to be the outcome of this
zest for luxurious personal comfort?
</p>

<p>
To what extent the church ought to take part
in the economic regeneration of the world was one
of the questions which Mr. Prentiss had always
found perplexing.  He was well aware that his
parishioners as a body were not fond of hearing
him preach on what they called secular subjects.
So long as he confined himself to enumerating
spiritual truths, they were not averse to his
illustrating his stigmas upon sin by generalizations
from current worldly abuses; but he knew that
many shook their heads and declared that the
cobbler should stick to his last when he ventured to
discourse on political topics or the relations of
labor and capital.  Mr. Prentiss was not aware,
however, that some of this prejudice proceeded
from the circumstance that he was apt to lose his
head on such occasions; but, on the other hand,
much of it was genuine disinclination for advice
from the pulpit on subjects which, to quote the
women parishioners, were not spiritual, and, to
quote the men, were none of his business.  His
congregation was almost entirely composed of pew
owners, people with vested rights, among which
appeared to be the right not to be harrowed by
socialistic doctrines.  They were ready to help the
poor in any way which he would suggest, and they
had supplied him with a mission church where he
could reach the ignorant and needy more effectively,
but they argued that he had better leave
to the politicians all suggestions tending to disturb
the existing industrial order.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Prentiss sometimes sighed over these
limitations, but he had become used to them, and in a
measure, with advancing years, he had, in his
endeavor to be a man of the world in order to remain
a more useful Christian, accepted the doctrine that
he had no plan to substitute for the present
economic system, and that he must make the best of
the existing situation.  So, in practical, daily life,
he exhorted the rich to give their money and
themselves to the advancement of their fellow men, and
the poor to shun vice and bear their privations
with patience, while he held forth the promise of
the church of an existence hereafter for the pure
in heart where all the seeming inconsistencies of
this mortal life would be explained and justified.
Not being endowed with much sense of humor,
Mr. Prentiss, as he waxed in years, and St. Stephen's
became the fashionable church of the city,
had found less and less difficulty in accommodating
himself to this point of view, and in devoting all
his ardor to reclaiming souls for Christ.  After
all, was not his mission to help men and women as
he found them?  First of all to minister to their
souls, and in the name of Christianity to lift them
from the slough of human suffering and misfortune
that he might expound to them the loving mercies
of the Lord?  The things of the earth were not
the things of the spirit, and he was more tenacious
than in his youth of the prerogatives of the church
as an institution controlling human consciences by
standards of its own, founded on the teachings of
the Prince of Peace.  Nevertheless, being reasonably
clear-headed and fearless, he was not without
the suspicion at times that this reasoning was
mystical, and in the face of facts he had every now
and then his unpleasant quarters of an hour.
</p>

<p>
This was one of them to-night.  His hostess,
when the dinner was over, had left him to a cigar
and his own devices in the library.  He was to
join her presently and be shown her daughter's
wedding presents.  He had been invited to
dine in order that he might see them, but
Mrs. Wilson and he both knew that this was an
excuse for a quiet evening together in which
they might compare notes concerning their mutual
interests.  Reaching out to knock off the ash of
his cigar into a dainty porcelain wheelbarrow, he
noticed a new photograph on the mantel-piece and
rose to examine it.  He recognized it as one of
Clarence Waldo, the New Yorker to whom Miss
Lucille Wilson was betrothed.  The sight of this
young man's countenance did not serve to restore
Mr. Prentiss's serenity.  On the contrary, he stood
gazing at the photograph with an expression which
suggested that his soul was still perturbed.  The
face was that of a man of twenty-seven or eight
with delicate features&mdash;thin lips, a long nose and
an indefinable haughtiness of expression which was
made up of weariness and disdain.  He had large
eyes which lacked lustre, and his sparse hair gave
the effect of having been carefully brushed.  The
clergyman had met him only a few times, and
Mr. Prentiss had never forgotten the first occasion,
which was at Lucille's coming-out ball three years
before.  He had happened to find himself in
Mr. Waldo's path when the young man was in the act
of carrying everything before him with a plate
of salad for his partner, and he had never
forgotten the cold impertinence of the New Yorker's
stare.  Paul Howard, Lucille's cousin, who
witnessed the encounter, said afterward that Clarence
had given Mr. Prentiss the dead eye, which was
a telling description of the stoniness of the
fashionable New Yorker's gaze.  Mr. Prentiss had never
heard this diagnosis, but he had remembered the
episode.  He regarded it, however, merely as
additional evidence of the lack of reverence on the
part of the young men of the day&mdash;and the young
women, too, for the matter of that&mdash;not merely
for sacred things, but for everything and
everybody which were in their way or did not happen
to appeal to their fancy.  But though he considered
this absence of social politeness as one of the
cardinal failings of the age, his present thoughts
regarding Lucille's future husband were not
concerned with it.
</p>

<p>
Since the engagement had been announced four
months ago he had been making inquiries, and the
information which he had received was in his mind
and troubled his soul as a corollary of the other
problems which had just been haunting him.  It
was not of a character to justify him in forbidding
the bans&mdash;not even in remonstrating with Mrs. Wilson,
unless she were to ask his advice or provide
him with an opportunity.  But he deplored
sincerely that this young man was to marry his
friend's daughter.  Was this to be the outcome,
the crowning of the wealth of love and solicitude
which had been lavished on this only child&mdash;a child
brought up in his church?  Was it for this that
Lucille had been made the central figure of costly
entertainments for the last three years, in the hope
that she might make a brilliant match?  Decidedly,
it was a puzzling world, and circumstances seemed
to be conspiring to cloud his horizon and disturb
his digestion at a time when he ought to be
enjoying himself and taking his ease.
</p>

<p>
"What does he offer her?" he said to himself.
"Twelve months of sporting life&mdash;American
sporting life.  A superb stable, a four-in-hand
coach and steam yacht, polo, golf, the horse show,
cards, six months every third year in Europe, their
summers at Newport, their winters at Palm Beach.
The fortune which she will bring him will enable
them to live in the lap of luxury all the year round,
and he will teach her to regard those who are not
rich and who do not imitate their manner of life
as beneath their notice.  I know the kind&mdash;I know
the kind."
</p>

<p>
Soft footsteps interrupted his mental soliloquy.
"No, thank you," he exclaimed in a tone which
was almost militant to the waiters who approached
him with a tray.  Mr. Prentiss supposed that
another form of stimulant was being offered him,
for Madeira, liqueurs and coffee had been successively
brought in and solemnly presented to him
by the two men servants, one of whom seemed to
him as superfluous as a plumber's helper.  Then
as his gaze, which had been inward, appreciated
that the silver gilt tumbler contained apollinaris
water, he called them back and emptied the glass.
He had finished his cigar and it was time to rejoin
his hostess.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap08"></a></p>

<h3>
VIII
</h3>

<p>
Mr. Prentiss continued his monologue on
his way to the drawing-room.  He imagined
himself saying to Mrs. Wilson, "You know
that I believe in toleration, and that I would not
set or preach an ascetic standard of life.  I
believe&mdash;my church believes&mdash;that it is not profitable to
the human soul to mortify the flesh in every-day
life or refuse to enjoy the comforts of civilization.
But the set of people to which this young man
belongs are cumberers of the soil and a menace to
society.  It is not merely a question of taste, but
of Christian morals.  We have nothing to do with
other nations; our concern is with the social life
of this nation and whether we are to foster and
encourage a pleasure-loving, self-indulgent, and
purposeless leisure class."
</p>

<p>
Yet though his thoughts thus shaped themselves
in fervent words, he was conscious that in the
absence of a cue his lips must remain sealed.  There
was a limit imposed by society on the priestly office
which he could not overstep without appearing
officious, and thus weakening his influence.  Were
it a case of notorious dissipation or some palpable
fault or blemish, it would be his duty to speak.
But he had no such data at his command.  Clarence
Waldo was simply a fastidious idler, pretentious,
and indifferent to the vital interests of life.
It could not even be charged that he was marrying
Lucille for her money, as he had a competency of
his own.  They would be able to buy all the dogs
and horses in the country if they saw fit.  But his
own tongue was tied.  To all appearances
Mrs. Wilson was content.  At the time she had
announced her daughter's engagement to him, she
had said, in response to his earnest inquiry if she
were satisfied&mdash;said it with a blithe smile, as
though, on the whole, the best had happened&mdash;"I
should have been glad of course, if Lucille had
chosen a man of conspicuous talent, a future
United States Senator or successful artist or author.
If she had loved her lord, I should not have
objected to a title, because, after all, even to a
free-born American, there is a certain compensation in
becoming the mother of dukes and regenerating
an ancient line.  But Clarence is well connected,
and the child is in love with him.  So long as she
is happy, that is the essential thing."
</p>

<p>
Since then he had become better informed as
to the young man's tendencies.  But if Lucille was
in love with him and her mother acquiescent, what
was there to do?  The church could not interfere
beyond a certain point without giving offence.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson was not in the drawing-room, but
Mr. Prentiss caught a glimpse of her at her desk
in a smaller room which led out of it.  She called
to him that she was answering a note and would
join him presently.  The clergyman seated himself
and picking up from a low teak table beside him
a paper-cutter fashioned on a Japanese sword hilt
he compressed his fingers on the handle as an
outlet to his perplexity.  Had he been walking in the
fields, he would have cut off the heads of the
dandelions with his cane.  Marriage was a sacrament,
the most solemn undertaking in life, yet how
impossible it was to regulate matrimony for others.
He glanced around the room admiringly.  Already
the musical notes of his hostess's voice had served
to dissipate partially the miasma of doubt which
had been assailing him.  This main apartment was
one of a series of drawing-rooms, each furnished
with an exquisite magnificence suggestive of the
salons of France in the days of Louis XIV, save
that there was a superabundance of artistic
furnishings; hence the sight was confused by the array
of costly tapestries, marbles, bronzes, china,
and gilt or otherwise illuminated ornaments which
almost contended for space with one another,
though the rooms were of large proportions.  One
feature of Benham's renaissance was the ambition
to outdo the past in size and gorgeousness, but
Mrs. Wilson's advisers had been animated also by
the desire for artistic success, and it was only in
its wealth of material that their and her&mdash;for she
had been the leading spirit after all&mdash;performance
was open to criticism.  Here in Benham, where
twenty years before the horse-hair sofa was still
an object of admiring regard in the homes of the
well-to-do, the desert had blossomed with the rose,
and a veritable palace had been established.  And,
as Mr. Prentiss reflected, joining his finger-tips
across his waist-band, all this lavish expenditure
meant the return by the rich of accumulated wealth
into circulation for the benefit of those who labored
for their bread, which was another of Mr. Carleton
Howard's telling truths.
</p>

<p>
The swift, animated, but noiseless glide of
Mrs. Wilson into the room and onto a sofa, from which
she flashed at him a gracious, electric look of
attention with the words, "And now, my friend, I am
entirely at your disposal.  It was a note which had
to be answered at once"&mdash;restored Mr. Prentiss's
serenity.  She was one of those pleasant persons
in whose presence the world seems justified.  When
she entered a room people were apt to pay tribute
by a pause in whatever they were doing, and she
became the focus of attention.  The effect of her
graceful energy was largely responsible for this,
suggesting the forceful but silent sweep of a ship.
She had lost the figure and the countenance of
youth, but though her abundant crinkly hair was
grizzled no one ever thought of her age except to
observe that she was handsomer than as a younger
woman.  She had never been a beauty; she was
now a distinguished looking, comely, and effective
matron.  She was tall and rather willowy, but not
thin, with a proud, resolutely carried head, an
agreeable straight nose, short rather than long (her
best feature) a spirited, sympathetic smile, eyes
fundamentally gray, which changed as her
thoughts changed, and ingratiating but elegant
manners.  Her face, notably the cheeks and lips,
was a trifle full, suggesting dimples, and possibly
to the critical a too-manifest desire to please.  Her
obvious pose&mdash;which, though deliberate was
entirely genuine&mdash;was to be exquisite, sympathetic,
and intellectual, and for the expression of this
range of qualities she had serviceable allies in her
musical voice, a bewitching way of showing just
enough of her teeth, when she became vivacious,
and her ornamental clothes, which always suited
her.  On this evening she wore an old-gold gown
with jet and lace accompaniments, an aigrette of
crimson gauze with which the plumage of her fan
was in harmony, a band of magnificent pearls
around her neck, and on her breast, though such
ornaments were not strictly in fashion, a large
brooch of fine workmanship containing a miniature
of two children of tender age.  Of these children
one had died shortly after the miniature was
painted, the other was her daughter Lucille.  Her
soul was dedicated to two interests, her joy and
ambition as a mother, and to the cause of social
human progress.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson had been for fifteen years a
widow, and, though her husband held a hallowed
place in her heart, even she was conscious that the
broad scope of her present life dated from the
period when, seeking a refuge from her own grief
and loneliness, she had welcomed diverse social
employment.  Her husband, Randolph, a hero
and a colonel of the Civil War, had claimed her
on his return as a bride.  They were ardent lovers,
and they had never ceased to be so, certainly not
in theory.  Some of Mrs. Wilson's knowing friends
were fond of insinuating, when the humor for gossip
prevailed, that he had died just in time, which
was their way of intimating that she had outgrown
him.  But these dissectors of hearts did not
perhaps sufficiently remember that her own blossoming
forth into the woman she now was had been
subsequent to her husband's death.  Nor did they
take sufficiently into account the bewildering course
of events which had attended her progress.
Colonel Wilson, a man of small means at the time of
their marriage, had become her brother's partner.
The properties in which he was interested at the
time of his death had subsequently proved so
valuable that she had found herself presently the
possessor of a million, a sum which had quadrupled
in the keeping of her brother, Carleton Howard,
one of the most powerful financiers in the country.
Opportunity surely had waited on her widening
aspirations, enabling her finally to establish
herself in this magnificent home surrounded by all the
æsthetic attractions and many of the treasures of
modern civilization.
</p>

<p>
Probably Mrs. Wilson herself had never sought
to analyze the past by the light of the present,
realizing, as we all do, that life unbeknown to us
has halting-places which become, as we look back,
the dividing lines between what are almost
separate existences.  Though at her husband's death
she had made no resolutions regarding the future,
she had never felt the impulse to marry again, so
engrossing were the concerns of motherhood and
social responsibility.
</p>

<p>
"You spoke at dinner of wishing my assistance
in some case in which you are interested.  Will you
tell me about it now before we look at the
presents?" Mrs. Wilson continued with smiling interest.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, yes."  Mr. Prentiss was glad to have this
recalled to his mind.  There was no chance here
for doubt or perplexity.  "It is rather out of the
usual run of charity cases.  The personality of the
woman, I mean.  The circumstance that her husband
has run away and left her penniless, with two
young children to support is, alas! only too
common."
</p>

<p>
"Poor thing!  How can I be of service?"
</p>

<p>
"The woman&mdash;her name is Mrs. Stuart&mdash;notwithstanding
her disastrous marriage, seems to me
distinctly superior.  She came to Benham some six
or seven years ago, and I knew her a little at
St. Stephen's before she was a wife.  Indeed, I
married them, and made some inquiries at the time
concerning the husband's circumstances, but learned
nothing to his discredit.  She has found him to be a
godless, unscrupulous person with drinking habits,
and recently he has deserted her on the grandiose
plea that they would be happier apart.  She will
be happier; I am sure of that; but I have been
exercised as to how to enable her to become
self-supporting.  She is called to higher usefulness than
scrubbing or plain sewing, but though I have discerned
in her capabilities and refinement, she is not
at present equipped for any active employment."
</p>

<p>
"Which only tends to show, my friend, that
every woman"&mdash;Mrs. Wilson paused an instant&mdash;"every
woman who has not independent means of
her own, I mean, should be educated to be
self-supporting&mdash;should have some definite
bread-winning occupation which would render her
independent of the man she marries in case he dies or
misbehaves.  I was thinking the other day that a
society formed to advocate this doctrine before
clubs of girls as a condition of marriage would
prove efficacious."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Prentiss nodded.  "It is certainly the duty
of Christian society to provide additional
safeguards against the consequences of improvident
wedlock.  In this particular instance, the young
woman plighted her troth while she was studying
to become a kindergarten teacher.  She was a
country doctor's daughter, and is gentle and
refined, as well as intelligent in appearance&mdash;one of
those lithe, tense American personalities in which
the spirit appears to burn at the expense of the
body, but which, like the willow, bend but do not
break under the stress of life."
</p>

<p>
"She sounds interesting, and I do not see that
she has been to blame.  We must raise a fund for
her.  With how large a subscription shall I head
the list?"  Though Mrs. Wilson gave freely on
merely charitable grounds, she gave with more
enthusiasm when the objects of her bounty had not
offended her sense of the social fitness of things.
</p>

<p>
The clergyman put out his hand.  "That
wouldn't do exactly, I think.  She is not too proud
to let us help her for a few weeks with coal and
groceries until she can earn for herself.  She
realizes that she must be sensible, if only for the
children's sake.  She has an independent simplicity of
nature and clearness of perception which would
stand in the way, I fear, of her accepting a
donation such as you have in mind; though I should
dearly love to allow you to pay off the
encumbrances on their house, which, owing to her
husband's rascalities have eaten up her little
home&mdash;her patrimony.  But I am sure she would refuse."
</p>

<p>
"I see.  We should think less of her if she
allowed herself to be pauperized, much as I should
enjoy giving her a deed of her home free and
clear&mdash;the mere thought of it causes me a thrill of
pleasure.  But the worst of such tragedies is that
we are most powerless to aid those who are most
deserving."  Mrs. Wilson leaned back among her
cushions, and, drawing a pale pink rose from a
bunch in a vase at her elbow, laid it along her
cheek and inhaled its fragrance.  "If she were an
undiscerning, common spirit with workaday
sensibilities, as so many of them are, she would not
refuse, but&mdash;half the pleasure of giving would be
lost.  It is a privilege and the fashion to be
charitable, but so much of our charity consists in filling
the mouths and clothing the bodies of the wretched
who will never be appreciably different or strive
to be different from what they are."
</p>

<p>
"The poor we have always with us," murmured
the clergyman.
</p>

<p>
"Always.  The shiftless, dirty, unaspiring,
unæsthetic poor.  The dregs and lees of human
endeavor.  We must feed and clothe them, of course,
and help them to help themselves, but sometimes
I forget the pathos of it all in the ugliness and
squalor.  Consequently, when the chance to do
real good comes, it is a pity not to be able to lift
the burden completely.  What, then, can I do for
this young person?"
</p>

<p>
"I have thought over her case for the last
forty-eight hours, and have come to the conclusion that,
as she has no special training, her best chance for
employment is to learn short-hand and to use the
typewriter.  I understand that women proficient in
this vocation can usually secure steady work at a
fair wage.  Though Mrs. Stuart would be unwilling
to accept a direct gift of money, I feel confident
that she would not refuse to let us put her in
the position to become self-supporting&mdash;that is,
defray the cost of the lessons necessary to make
her a competent stenographer or office clerk.  And
I thought you might be glad to pay for these
lessons&mdash;a matter of six months or so."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Prentiss had taken up the paper-cutter
again, and he passed the flat of the metal blade
across his palm as though he were smoothing out
his plan as well as the creases.
</p>

<p>
"Gladly," she responded.  "For as long as you
desire.  And, perhaps, when she has learned what
is necessary, my brother may know of some
opening for her down-town."
</p>

<p>
"Very likely," answered Mr. Prentiss, with
resonant acquiescence.  "The same thought had
occurred to me."
</p>

<p>
"And, in the meantime, since you tell me that
she is competent and refined, my secretary, who
will have her hands full with the details of the
wedding, may be able to give her occasional
errands to do.  You may tell her to call when her
plans are adjusted and to ask for me."
</p>

<p>
"Excellent.  And we shall both be your debtors."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson smiled graciously, showing the
dimples in her cheeks.  The demands made upon
her for pecuniary aid were of daily, it might be
said hourly, occurrence.  Whoever in Benham was
in search of money applied to her, and the post
brought her solicitations from all sorts of people,
among whom were the undeserving or importunate,
as well as the needy or humanitarian.  As lady
bountiful, she purposed to exercise intelligent
discrimination in her charities, and she accepted
thanks as a tribute to that quality.
</p>

<p>
"Come," she said, rising, "I will show you the
presents.  Only think, four hundred of them, and
so many beautiful things!  People have been so
kind.  Several of my brother's friends in New
York have sent most exquisite tokens&mdash;a necklace
of diamonds and pearls from Mr. Fenton the
banker, a gold dessert service from his railroad
ally, Mr. Kennard."
</p>

<p>
She led the way from the drawing-room suite
into the hall, where electricity in artistic guises
illuminated the broad panellings, a splendid Terriers
and three or four bronze or marble statuaries of
rare merit, and up the stair-case to the next floor
into what was known as the morning-room&mdash;an
apartment where Mrs. Wilson conducted her
affairs and did her reading and thinking.  This was
a combination of study and æsthetic boudoir.
There were seductive sofas and quaint capacious
chairs supplied with brightly colored cushions, and
dainty draperies, all in silken stuffs of patterns
reminiscent of the Orient.  Art, in its most delicate
and spiritual forms, breathed from every object of
furniture or decoration; from the small pictures&mdash;some
in oils, some in water-colors&mdash;which merited
and often demanded the closest scrutiny; from the
few vases of entrancing shape and hue, from the
interesting photographs in beautiful frames, from
the curious and rare memorials of travel and wise
choice of what cunning fingers had wrought with
infinite labor.  As in the rest of the house, there
was still too much wealth of material, too much
scintillation and conglomeration of color, but
the intent had been&mdash;and not without success&mdash;to
produce a more subtle atmosphere than prevailed
outside, as of an inner temple.  Prominent
in one angle stood Mrs. Wilson's desk, rose-wood,
inlaid with poetic gilt tracery, and littered with
the correspondence of a busy woman.  Books and
other articles of daily use lying here and there
without effort at order gave to the room the air of
being the intimate abode of a human soul.  Opening
out of this was a private music-room, which was
used by Mrs. Wilson and her daughter in preference
to the large music-room on the street floor
intended for musical parties and dances.  Here
were the wedding presents, a dazzling array of
gold, silver, jewels, glass, china, and ornamental
knick-knacks, tastefully arranged on tables
introduced for the purpose.  As they entered an
attendant withdrew into the hall.
</p>

<p>
"We have thought it more prudent to have a
watchman on guard by night and day," explained
Mrs. Wilson; "for I suppose it is true, as one of
those ridiculous newspaper items asserts, that these
gifts represent at least one hundred thousand
dollars.  By the way," she continued, with a gentle
sigh, "it is so difficult to know what attitude to
adopt with the newspaper people.  If one refuses
them the house, their sensibilities are hurt and they
are liable to invent falsehoods or write disagreeable
paragraphs.  If they are allowed to inspect
everything, they publish details which make one's
heart sick, and make one appear a vain fool.  How
is a person in my position to be courteous toward
the power of the press and yet to maintain the
right to privacy?  Is not this superb?" she added,
holding up a crest of diamonds in the form of a
tiara.  "My brother's present to Lucille."
</p>

<p>
"Beautiful&mdash;beautiful, indeed," murmured the
clergyman.  The sight of all these costly things
was bewildering to his mind as well as to his eyes.
"Ah, the press&mdash;the press, it is a problem, indeed.
We would seem to have the right to individual
privacy, would we not?  And yet in this age of
ours, pressure is so often used upon us to thrust
our wares into the shop-windows&mdash;as in my case,
sermons for newspapers of the most sensational
class&mdash;on the plea of a wider usefulness, a closer
touch with the wilderness of souls, that it is
difficult to know where the rights of the public end as
to what one has.  What would seem to be vanity
may often be only another form of philanthropy.
And yet&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And yet," interposed Mrs. Wilson, as she
singled out an enchanting fan of gold and ivory and
the most exquisite lace and spread it for his
inspection, "why should I pander to the vulgar curiosity
of the public?  It is none of their business."
</p>

<p>
"In a matter of this kind I quite agree with you.
If they could see all these beautiful things, there
might be some sense in it; but that would be out
of the question, of course."
</p>

<p>
"That will be the next step; our houses thrown
open to the madding crowd.  Six newspapers&mdash;two
from New York&mdash;applied recently for leave
to see the presents.  I intended to refuse firmly,
but to my astonishment Lucille seemed disappointed.
It never occurred to me that she would
not hate the publicity.  She gave a little shriek
and said, 'Mamma, how dreadful!' and then added
in the next breath, 'Everybody does it, and, as
something is sure to be printed, might it not be
better to make certain that it's correct?'  A day
or two later she was photographed in her tiara,
and from what has transpired since I fear that the
idea of publicity was not foreign to her thought.
My child, Mr. Prentiss!  Only think of it!  One
can never quite understand the point of view of
the rising generation.  I consulted Carleton, and
he grew successively irate, contemplative,
philosophical, and weak-kneed.  In short, a week ago
a reportorial woman, with the social appetite of a
hyena and the keen-eyed industry of a ferret, passed
the forenoon in the house and went away with a
photograph of Lucille in the tiara.  And what is
worst of all, in spite of my humiliation at the
whole proceeding, I am decidedly curious to see
what she has written."
</p>

<p>
The sound of voices in the morning-room broke
in upon this confession.  "Ah, here you are, Aunt
Miriam!  I have brought you an artistic masterpiece
with a felicitous biography of the distinguished
heroine.  Behold and admire!"
</p>

<p>
The speaker was Paul Howard, Mrs. Wilson's
nephew.  He advanced from the doorway with
radiant, teasing face, holding out a newspaper at
which he pointed delightedly.  At his heels
followed Lucille and Clarence Waldo, she protesting,
yet betraying by her laughing confusion that her
indignation was half-hearted; he stalking with
self-important gravity save for a thin smile, the limit
of his deliberate contributions to the gayety of
nations unless under the influence of alcoholic
conviviality.  At men's gatherings there was a stage
in the proceedings when Clarence Waldo became
decorously mellow and condescended&mdash;indeed,
expected to be asked&mdash;to sing one of three or four
quasi-humorous ditties at his command, a function
which he seemed to regard as an important social
contribution and for which he practised in secret.
Also, after luncheon or dinner, he was liable to
lay down the law in loud tones in regard to current
sporting affairs.  But his habitual manner was
languid and his expression cold, as though he feared
to compromise himself by interest or enthusiasm.
He was very tall.  In the centre of his crown was
a bald spot.  He stooped slightly, and, except
among his intimates, looked straight before him
lest he might see someone whom he did not wish
to know.  In the rear of this family party came
Carleton Howard, stepping firmly yet deliberately,
as he always did, as though he walked abreast of
Time, not tagging at her skirts like so many of his
contemporaries&mdash;a fine figure of a man approaching
sixty, with a large body, but not corpulent, a
broad brow, a strong, defiant nose, iron-gray hair
and a closely cut iron-gray mustache, clear, fearless,
yet reflective eyes, and a mouth the pleasant
tension of which indicated both determination and
tact.  He was smoking a cigar, and had come in
from his own library to enjoy the bearding of his
sister by the young people.

<p>
Before Mrs. Wilson could ascertain what it
was, Lucille made a dash at the newspaper.
Paul thrust it behind his back.
</p>

<p>
"Give it to me, Paul," demanded the young
woman, imperiously.  "I order you to give it to
me," she reiterated, tapping her foot.  "You are
a hateful tease."
</p>

<br />
&quot;Give it to me, Paul,&quot; demanded the young woman imperiously
</p>

<p>
"Surely, my fair cousin, you're not going to
deprive your mother of the satisfaction of gazing
on this work of art, and reading this appreciative
description of your personal charms?  Can you
not see how impatient she is to have it all to herself?"
</p>

<p>
"You have certainly whetted my curiosity,
Paul," said Mrs. Wilson.
</p>

<p>
"I forbid you to show it to her."
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
"It is too ridiculous and foolish, and the
picture&mdash;"  Her criticism on that score instead of
seeking words culminated in another spring, which
Paul evaded by wheeling spryly about so that he
still faced her.
</p>

<p>
Paul Howard was an ornamental, attractive
specimen of athletic, optimistic American youth; a
fine animal of manly, well-knit proportions with no
sign of physical weakness or of effeminacy in his
person or his face.  His countenance was open and
ruddy; his eyes clear blue, his hair light brown.
His lip was scrupulously clean-shaven, exposing
the full, pleasant strength of his father's mouth.
Indeed, in conformity with the prevailing fashion
among his contemporaries, he wore neither mustache,
beard, nor whiskers, as though in immaculate
protest against every style of hirsute ornamentation,
from the goat-like beard of Methodistical
statesmanship to the spruce mustache and
well-trimmed whiskers of men of the world of fifteen
years earlier.  He was a Harvard graduate; he
had been on the foot-ball team, and a leading
spirit in the social life of the college; had been
around the globe since graduation, and spent
nearly a year shooting big game in the Rockies
and getting near to nature, as he called it, by
living on a ranch.  All this as preliminary to taking
advantage of the golden spoon which was in his
mouth at his birth.  At twenty-three he had
signified that he was ready to buckle down to the
responsibilities of guarding and increasing the family
possessions, an announcement delighting his
father's heart, who had feared, perhaps, lest his
only son might conclude to become merely a
clubman or a poet.  This was the fourth year of his
novitiate, much of which had been spent in New
York, where Mr. Howard, though his home was
in Benham, had established a branch of his
banking-house, at the head of which he intended
presently to place Paul.  On the young man's
twenty-fifth birthday the magnate had made him a
present of a million dollars so as to put him on his
feet and permit him to support a wife.  If this
were a hint, Paul had taken it.  Though absorbed
in financial undertakings of magnitude (which
had included the electric street-car combination
hostile to the aspirations of Emil Stuart), he had
wooed and wed one of the prettiest girls in
Benham, and he possessed, not many blocks away, a
stately establishment of his own.  He was
accustomed to walk hand in hand with prosperity, and
this habit was reflected in the gay and slightly
self-satisfied quality of his manliness.
</p>

<p>
After foiling his cousin for a few moments,
with a tantalizing smile, a new idea occurred to
him.  He held out the newspaper, saying, "Very
well then, here it is.  I dare you, Lucille, to
destroy it.  Nothing would induce you to part
with it."
</p>

<p>
Lucille snatched the sheet from his hand, and
her ruffled hesitation indicated that to destroy it
was the last thing she had intended.  In another
instant she tore the newspaper into strips with an
air of disdain and cast them on the floor.
Delighted at the success of his taunt, Paul stooped
and gathering the fragments began to piece them
together.
</p>

<p>
"That is only a blind.  She knows she can buy
a dozen copies to-morrow.  Listen, Aunt Miriam,
to this gem which I have rescued: 'The fair bride
has a complexion of cream of alabaster, with
beautiful almond-shaped eyes, and hair of black
lustre, which, rising from her forehead in queenly
bands, seems the natural throne of the glittering
diadem in the picture, one of her choicest bridal
gifts.'  Could anything be more exquisite and
fetching?" He gave a laugh which was almost
a whoop of exultation.
</p>

<p>
"No matter, Lucille," said Mrs. Wilson,
coming to her daughter's rescue.  "It is only envy on
Paul's part.  The newspapers did not make half
so much of his wedding."  In her own heart she
did not approve of the publicity, but the sense of
importance which it conveyed was not without its
effect even on her.  Besides, the personal
description, though florid in style, was to her maternal
eyes not an exaggerated estimate of her daughter's
charms.
</p>

<p>
"The writer was evidently under the spell of
her subject," said Mr. Prentiss, gallantly.
Though tolerant of banter, especially at clerical
gatherings, and partial to Paul Howard as one
of the young men whom he desired to draw into
closer union with the church, the idea of the
possibilities of the newspaper as a dispenser of benefits
was still in his mind, and served to minimize the
vanity, if any, of his friend's daughter.
</p>

<p>
"Quite naturally, Mr. Prentiss," retorted the
tormenting Paul, "for the subject gave a private
audience to the writer only a few days ago."
</p>

<p>
Paul spoke from the desire to tease, not because
he objected actively to the connivance of his cousin
with the designs of the press.  If the opportunity
to do away with the whole practice of prying into
and advertising private social matters had been
presented to him, he would gladly have embraced
it, and welcomed at the same time the further
opportunity to tar and feather or duck the race of
social reporters.  But as an astute and easy-going
American he recognized the prevalence of the
habit, and though personally he tried to dodge
with good humor the impertinent inquiries of press
agents, he was not disposed to censure those who
yielded to their importunities.  Indeed, Paul
Howard was so bubbling over with health prosperity,
and a generally roseate conception of life
as he saw it, that he shrank from active criticism
of existing social conditions.  He was a strong
patriot, and it pleased him to believe that
Americans were world-conquerors and world-teachers.
Hence that it was the part of good Americans to
join hands all round and, avoiding nice strictures,
to put their shoulders to the wheel of progress.
</p>

<p>
"How absurd you are, Paul," answered Lucille.
"That woman badgered me with questions, and
was positively pathetic into the bargain, for she
confided to me that she hated the whole business,
but that her bread and butter depended on it.  She
was certain to write something, and so rather
than have everything wrong, I told her a few
things."
</p>

<p>
"And gave her your photograph in the tiara."
</p>

<p>
"She asked for it.  She saw it lying on the
table.  Wasn't that better than to be caricatured
by some snap-shot with a camera?"
</p>

<p>
The dire results of what would have ensued had
she been less accommodating seemed so convincing
to Lucille as she recited them that her tone changed
from defence to conviction.
</p>

<p>
"I know a woman," said Clarence Waldo,
"who told her servants not to let any of those
newspaper beggars inside the house, and what do
you suppose happened?  On the day of the
wedding there appeared an insulting account of the
affair with everything turned topsy-turvy and
disparaging remarks about both families.  It's an
awful bore, but when people of our sort are
married the public doesn't like to be kept in the dark,
you know."
</p>

<p>
"There!  You see!" exclaimed Lucille, triumphantly.
</p>

<p>
The description of this young lady which her
cousin had read was fundamentally correct.  Her
eyes could scarcely be called almond-shaped, but
their curves were more gradual than those of
most American women, a feature which, in
conjunction with her thin lips and thin, pointed nose,
gave to her countenance an expression of
fastidiousness, which was characteristic.  She was an
example of the so-called Gibson girl, with a tall
and springy, yet slight, figure, and a race-horse air
which suggested both mettle and disdain.  She
had been brought up on the theory of free
development&mdash;a theory for which not her mother but
the tendency of the day was responsible.  Parents,
when it comes to a choice in educational methods,
are apt at heart to recognize their own personal
ignorance, and those with the highest aims for
their offspring are most likely to adopt the newest
fashionable graft on human experience.  We are
perpetually on the look-out for discoveries which
will enable our children to become the bright
particular stars which we are not.  So what more
natural than that Mrs. Wilson, with her ardent
bent for improving social conditions, should
swallow&mdash;hook, bait, and sinker&mdash;the theory that the
budding intelligence should be cajoled and
humored, not thwarted and coerced?  The idea thus
pursued at kindergarten, that everything should
be made easy and agreeable for the infant mind,
had been steadily adhered to, and Lucille could
fairly be said to have had her own way all her
life.  This own way had been at times bewildering,
not to say disheartening, to her mother.
Mrs. Wilson had expected and yearned for a soulful,
aspiring, poetic daughter with an ambition for
culture&mdash;herself, but reincarnated and much
improved.  Instead, Lucille had showed herself to
be utterly indifferent to poetry, lukewarm in
regard to culture, almost matter of fact in her
mental attitude, and sedulously enamoured of athletic
pursuits.  She had a fancy for dogs.  From fifteen
to eighteen she had followed golf, tennis, and
boating, hatless and with her sleeves rolled up to
her elbows, a free and easy and rather mannerless
maiden, Amazon-like in her bearing, but unlike
an Amazon in that she was a jolly companion to
the boys, who called her promiscuously by her
Christian name, as she did them by theirs.  Does
such a process of familiarity dull the edge of
romance?  We do not yet know.  Each rising
generation provides new problems for the wise elders,
and this was one of those which had kept
Mrs. Wilson uneasy.
</p>

<p>
She had looked forward to Lucille's formal
introduction to society as a social corrective, and
argued that, as soon as her daughter met the
world face to face, there would be a modification
both of Lucille's tastes and point of view.  So
strong is the emphasis laid by American mothers
in fashionable society on what is called "the
coming out" of their daughters that the concern
engendered by the approach of the ordeal could fitly
be described as a phase of hysteria.  The true
perspective of life becomes utterly and absurdly
distorted by apprehension lest the dear child should
not have "a good time" and by a fierce ambition
that she should have a better "time" than her
mates.  As a consequence, competition&mdash;that
absorbing passion of American character&mdash;is prone
to take advantage of all the opportunities at its
command, not merely to decorate the unprepossessing
or provide the duck with the environment
of the swan, but to make princesses out of goose
girls by sheer gorgeous manifestations of the
power of the almighty dollar.  We all know that
every woman in the world would prefer at heart
to be called wicked rather than common, unless
she were common&mdash;one of those extraordinary results
of the tyranny of the social instinct which
plays havoc with religious codes; and there is
probably no country where the most socially adept
are more intolerant of commonness than in
democratic America&mdash;a fact which should be
disconcerting to that form of socialism which yearns for
a dead-level.  Yet the tendency to exploit one's
daughters by means of money and to exploit them
even with barbaric splendor is current among our
most socially sophisticated people.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Carleton Howard's "coming-out" ball for
his niece was the most splendid function which
Benham had ever known, and for the next three
years Lucille's life had been one round of social
gayety, emphasized by the character of the things
done in her behalf by her family, which were
severally executed, if not conceived, in a spirit of
emulation, though Mrs. Wilson would doubtless
have resented the impeachment.  Mrs. Wilson
would have put the blame on the tendency of the
age, arguing that American society was becoming
more and more exacting in its Esthetic demands,
and that one must conform to existing usage in
order to lead.  But an examination of the facts
would reveal that whatever form of entertainment
was given by her for Lucille, as, for instance, the
four colored luncheons, when the food and the
table ornaments were successively red, orange,
blue, and heliotrope, and four sets of twelve
young girls stuffed themselves through eight
courses at mid-day, was carried out with a lavish
accentuation of new and costly effects.  It was
currently recognized that at her house the cotillion
favors and the prizes at games were worth having&mdash;silver
ornaments, pretty fans, things of price&mdash;always
a step beyond the last fashion, as though
the world would not be content to stand still, but
must be kept moving by more and more expensive
social novelties.
</p>

<p>
Though three years of this life had served to
transform the mannerless Amazon into a socially
correct and fastidious young woman, the result,
nevertheless, was a secret disappointment to her
mother, who had hoped that Lucille would develop
intellectual or æsthetic tastes under the influence
of these many advantages.  But what can a
mother whose daughter prefers athletics to art,
and fox terriers to philanthropy, do but make the
best of it?  Lucille had a will of her own and
seemed to know exactly what she wished, which
included marrying Clarence Waldo.  To thwart
her would be useless, to quarrel with her was out
of the question.  The only thing was to give her
as brilliant a wedding as possible and hope for
the best.  And after all, the best was by no means
out of the question.  Lucille was young and was
going to New York.  There was no telling what
a girl of twenty-one, with large means and the
best social opportunities, might not become by the
time she was thirty-five.  Mrs. Wilson had herself
cast sheep's eyes at New York as a residence
before building her new house, but she had decided
to remain dominant in a small puddle.  There
were compensations in doing so.  She flattered
herself that in this age of telephones and telepathy
she was able to keep in touch with the metropolis
and to get her social cues accordingly.  But to
have a daughter there would be interesting,
provided all went well.  The proviso should not be
overlooked; for Mrs. Wilson had not lowered her
own standards.  She was merely trying to extract
all the maternal comfort and pride she could out
of the existing situation.
</p>

<p>
"But, my dear Lucille," said Paul, intending a
crushing blow to his cousin's returning assurance,
"if you were really so anxious to escape notoriety,
you had merely to mention it to father.  A word
from him would have silenced every newspaper in
town."
</p>

<p>
"Scarcely that&mdash;scarcely that, young man,"
interposed Mr. Howard in a tone of friendly
authority.  "Very possibly, had I expressed a
preference, my wishes would have been respected
by one or two newspapers where I happen to have
some influence.  But your statement is altogether
too sweeping."  He spoke incisively, as though he
desired to deprecate the suggestion of the power
attributed to him by his more impulsive son.  "The
press is jealous of its privileges and must be
humored as a popular institution.  And, after all,
what does a little publicity matter?  You mustn't
mind what Paul says, Lucille.  There's no reason
to feel abashed because the public has been given
a chance to see the most charming bride of the
year."
</p>

<p>
"Abashed?  She is tickled to death," retorted
Paul.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Howard put his arm around his niece's
shoulder in the guise of a champion.  When
controversy had reached the stage where adjustment
was no longer possible, he was an uncompromising
antagonist.  But, as a successful man content with
existing conditions, he deplored friction in all the
relations of life, and to use an industrial phrase,
liked to see everything running smoothly.  He
laughed incredulously, and patting Lucille's arm
exclaimed, "Nonsense!"  Then, accosting the
clergyman, he added, "Now that this momentous
matter has been disposed of, Mr. Prentiss, will
you join me in a cigar in my own library?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Prentiss excused himself.  He had work
to do, and knew that if he remained he would be
apt to stay late.  But he was interested from a
theoretic stand-point in the discussion to which he
had been listening.
</p>

<p>
"You evidently feel as I do, Mr. Howard,"
he said, "that there are two sides to the question of
newspaper publicity, and that as good citizens we
are not always at liberty to insist on privacy."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Howard answered with the suave force
and clearness which gave to all his utterances the
effect of deliberate conviction.  "Mr. Prentiss, I
accept the institutions of my country as I find
them, and try to make the best of them.  There
are those whose only pleasure seems to be to carp
at what they do not wholly admire in our civic
system.  The press is one of the most powerful and
useful forces of modern life.  As such I value and
support it, though I'm keenly alive to the flagrant
evils and the cruel vulgarities for which it is daily
responsible.  But one can't afford as an American
citizen to condemn as worthless and ill-begotten
the things of which the people as a whole approve.
We must compromise here as in so many matters
in our complex civilization, and where trifles are
concerned, be complacent even against our convictions."
</p>

<p>
"Indisputably," said the clergyman.  "In the
constant faith that our tolerance will work for
improvement."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, but the newspapers are worse than ever,"
exclaimed Mrs. Wilson, with a sigh.  "One has to
wade through so much for so little.  I read them
scrupulously, because, if I do not, I'm sure to miss
something which I would like to see.  That sounds
inconsistent.  But why doesn't somebody establish
a really first-class newspaper?"
</p>

<p>
"Because a newspaper must be first of all a
successful business enterprise in order to be able
to exist," responded her brother.  "It is a
question of dollars and cents.  All that will come
presently.  And we are really improving all the time.
Just think of what a large and complicated
industry a modern newspaper establishment has grown
to be."  He spoke as though he saw and wished
to bring before his hearers' eyes the towering,
mammoth homes of the press in all our large
cities, the enforced outcome of the ever-increasing
popular demand for the world's news.  "Come,
Paul," he said, putting his arm through his son's,
"since Mr. Prentiss will not join us in a cigar we
will leave these good people to their own devices,
and go back to our work."
</p>

<p>
Paul, with a pocket full of documents and with
the obnoxious newspaper in his hand, had reached
the door of his father's house just as Lucille and
her betrothed were alighting from a carriage.
Lured by his goading remarks they had followed
him within and into his father's library, where at
a safe distance he had vouchsafed his cousin
glimpses of her tiara-crowned figure and read
aloud choice extracts until the spirit had moved
him to pass through the dividing door between the
two establishments in search of his aunt.  He had
left home with the idea of an hour's confabulation
with his father over certain schemes in which they
were jointly interested&mdash;a frequent habit of his
late in the evening.  Mr. Carleton Howard never
went to bed before one, and was invariably to be
found after eleven in his library reading or cogitating,
and always prepared at that quiet time to give
his keenest intelligence to the issues presented to
him.
</p>

<p>
Father and son passed along through the secret
passageway until they found themselves in
Mr. Howard's capacious library.  This superb room
was the result of an architect's conscientious
ambition to see what could be accomplished where
his client was obviously willing to obtain excellence
and had imposed on him no limits either in
respect to space or expense.  As regards size, it
bore the same relation to the ordinary library of
the civilized citizen that the Auditorium in
Chicago bears to every-day hotels, or the steamship
<i>Great Eastern</i> bore to other ocean carriers.
Consequently it was a little vast for strict cosiness.
The huge stamped leather chairs and sofas, though
inviting, seemed designed for persons of
elephantine figure, in order perhaps to avoid being
dwarfed.  But the shelves upon shelves of books
which covered completely from floor to ceiling
two of the walls&mdash;choice editions in fine
bindings&mdash;gained dignity from the superfluous dimensions.
If it be said in this connection that, to one familiar
with Mr. Howard's associations, the idea of many
storied office buildings might occur, the answer is
that he was responsible for nothing which the room
contained except its large and admirable display
of etchings, which, owing to almost weekly accretions,
had begun to disarrange the original æsthetic
scheme of the designer.  Mr. Howard had left
everything else to his architect, but etchings were
his hobby&mdash;one which had attracted his fancy
years before by accident, and had retained its hold
upon him.  He was familiar now, as a man of
sagacity and method, with the many bibliographical
and ethnological treasures by which he was
surrounded, and could exhibit them becomingly,
but when the conversation turned on the etcher's
art he was on firm ground and could talk as clearly
and authoritatively as about his railroads.
</p>

<p>
The banker chose his favorite seat, within
comfortable distance of one of the fire-places, facing
a beautiful polar bear-skin rug of extraordinary
size.  Close at hand was a large table with
writing materials and such magazine literature or
documents as he might wish to examine.  Adjustable
lights were at either elbow, and in the direct line of
his vision as he ordinarily sat were two of his
favorite works of art, an Albert Dürer and a
Wenceslaus Hollar.  He lighted another cigar
and, after a few puffs, said:
</p>

<p>
"That clergyman is decidedly a useful man.  He
has common sense and he has discretion."
</p>

<p>
"He isn't at all a bad sort," responded Paul.
Though guarded in form, this was intended as
an encomium, just as when Paul meant that he had
enjoyed himself thoroughly, he was apt to state
that he had had a pretty good time.  Anglo-Saxon
youth is proverbially shy of enthusiasm of the lips
lest it be suspected of freshness, as the current
phrase is.  "I wonder," he added a moment later
as he stood with his back to the wood fire, straightening
his sturdy shoulders against the mantel-piece,
"if he really believes all the things he preaches.
I'd just like to know for curiosity.  I suppose he
has to preach them even if he doesn't or else be
fired out, and he compromises with himself for
the mental reservation by the argument that if he
were out of it altogether, his usefulness and
occupation, like Othello's, would be gone.  That's the
way clergymen must have to argue nowadays, or
there wouldn't be many of them left at the old
stands."
</p>

<p>
Though he spoke colloquially, and with an assurance
which dispensed with reverence of treatment,
Paul intended to express genuine interest and
even sympathy.  Knowing that his father's ideas
on religious subjects were fundamentally liberal,
perhaps he was not averse to shocking him in a
mere matter of form.  Mr. Howard was silent a
moment, then replied:
</p>

<p>
"In every walk of life it is necessary, from time
to time, to sacrifice non-essentials for the sake of
the essentials.  As in everything else, so in
religion.  The world moves; opinions change.  Human
society cannot prosper without religion, and human
society never needed its influence more than to-day.
Sensible religion, of course."
</p>

<p>
"All sensible men have the same religion.  What
is that?  A sensible man never tells."  Paul was
quoting.  He had heard his father more than once
in his comments on the mysteries of life utter this
Delphic observation.  He laughed sweetly and
fearlessly.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Howard understood his son.  They were
good comrades.  He was aware that though Paul
felt free to jest at his remarks, his boy respected
his intellect and would ponder what he said.
</p>

<p>
"We agree about these things in the main, my
dear Paul.  If one were to go out on the
housetops and proclaim one's scepticism concerning
some of the supernatural dogmas which the mass
of the people find comfort in, how would it benefit
religion?  The world will find out soon enough
that it has been mistaken.  But we can neither of
us afford to forget that the security of human
society is dependent on religion.  One always
comes back to that in the end."
</p>

<p>
"It is good for the masses," said Paul, with a
chuckle.  "We, as the present lords of creation&mdash;captains
of industry&mdash;should encourage it for the
protection of our railroads, mines, and other
glorious monopolies.  That is one of the arguments
with which the truly great salved their consciences
before the French revolution."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Howard frowned slightly.  He knew that
Paul was only half in earnest, but the reference
to socialism was repellent to him, even though it
was rhetorical.  Why was he the possessor of
twenty millions?  Because he had been wiser and
more long-sighted than his competitors, because he
had used his clear brains to better advantage than
other men year after year, planning boldly and
executing thoroughly, making few mistakes and
taking advantage of every opportunity.  Because
he had fostered his powers, and controlled his
weaknesses.  He was rich because, like a true
American, he had conquered circumstances and
moulded them for his own and the world's profit.
Inequalities?  Must there not always be inequalities
so long as some men were strong and others
weak, some courageous and others shiftless?  And
as for charity, God knew he was willing to do&mdash;was
trying to do his part to help those who could
not or would not help themselves, and to encourage
all meritorious undertakings for the relief of
human society.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, we must humor the masses in this as in
a thousand matters, and our protection is their
protection.  I am not disturbed by your
insinuation, Paul.  Ignorance and sloth and folly and
false sentiment would bankrupt mankind in three
generations if it were not for the modern captains
of industry, as you call them."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Howard spoke somewhat sternly, as one
stating a proposition which was irrefutable and
yet was sometimes overlooked by an ungrateful
world.  "Similarly," he continued, "it is one
thing to be unorthodox in one's opinions and to
discard as childish articles of faith to which the
multitude adhere, another to deny the reality and
force of religion.  So, though I am a free thinker,
if you will, I regard it as no inconsistency to
uphold the hands of the church.  On the contrary,
every thoughtful man must realize that without
religion of some sort the human race would become
brutes again."
</p>

<p>
"And your form is to present fifty or a hundred
thousand to a hospital or a college whenever
you happen to feel like it, which every clergyman
will admit to be practical Christianity.  You
certainly give away barrels of money, father."
</p>

<p>
"I can afford to."  Mr. Howard was pleasantly
but not vain-gloriously aware that he had given
away a million dollars in the last three years.  "In
what better way can I share my profits with the
public than by entrusting it to trained educators
and philanthropists to spend for the common
good?  A great improvement, young man, on the
theory that every man jack of us should be
limited to the same wage, and originality, grit, and
enterprise be pushed off the face of the earth."
</p>

<p>
"Nevertheless it is tolerably pleasant to be your
son," said Paul, smiling brightly from his post
against the mantel-piece.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  But you have responsibilities as my son,
and pray do not imagine that I am blind to them.
I have made the money."  He paused a moment,
for he was looking back along the vista of
the years and recalling the succession of shrewd
undertakings by which his property had grown
from a few thousand dollars to imposing wealth.
"I have made the money, and it is for you to keep
and increase it&mdash;yes, increase it, remember&mdash;but
to spend it freely and wisely.  And if you ask me
what is wisely, I can only answer that this is a
problem for your generation.  If you will only use the
same pains in trying to solve it as I have in
accumulating the money, you will succeed.  You are
fond, Paul, of exploiting radical propositions, of
which you at heart disapprove, in order to test my
self-control.  Here is something, young man, to
chasten your spirit and keep your imagination busy."
</p>

<p>
"You see through me, father, don't you?  But
you'll admit that my familiarity with radical
doctrines is a good sign, especially since I recognize
their fallacies, for it shows that I sometimes think.
Yes, it is a great responsibility, but I wouldn't
exchange&mdash;not even with Gordon Perry."
</p>

<p>
"With whom?  Ah, yes, I remember; the attorney
who was on the foot-ball team with you at
Harvard.  And why should you consider changing
places with him?"
</p>

<p>
"Because the mere question of dollars and cents
interests him so little."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  You have been employing him lately, I
believe?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I like to throw what I can in his way.
He understands his business.  We lunched
together this morning.  I enjoy his humor, his
independence and his common sense, and at the same
time his enthusiasm."
</p>

<p>
"Concerning what?"
</p>

<p>
"Most things except the price of railroad shares
and the condition of the money market.  We
didn't refer to them once."  Paul paused with a
serio-comic sigh.  Mr. Howard knocked the white
ash from his cigar and responded:
</p>

<p>
"One of the reasons for sending you to college
was that you need not be confined in your
conversation to the money market.  Another that you
should be free in life to do as you chose."
</p>

<p>
"Don't be alarmed, father.  You know well
enough that nothing would induce me not to follow
your lead.  Give up business?  I couldn't.  I
love the power and excitement of it.  It's bred in
the bone, I suppose."
</p>

<p>
The banker's eyes kindled with pride in the son
of his heart.
</p>

<p>
"And it's because I know I'm myself that a
fellow like Don Perry fascinates me," pursued
Paul.  "There's no nonsense in him.  He objects
to cranks and mere psalm-singers as much as I do.
But he's absorbed in the social problems of the
day&mdash;legislative questions, philanthropic questions,
all the burning questions.  'And your young
men shall see visions.'  He is one of them.  You
will notice that I have not forgotten my Bible
altogether, father."
</p>

<p>
"We have, and to burn, reformers who see
visions and proclaim them from platforms which
have no underpinnings.  What we need are
reformers who will study and think before they
speak, and not seek to destroy the existing structure
of society before they have provided a serviceable
substitute."
</p>

<p>
"In other words, you are prepared to part with
a portion of your worldly possessions, but you
object to wholesale confiscation?"  Having
indulged in this pleasantry Paul took from the table
a packet of papers which he had brought with
him, as though to show that he had not forgotten
business concerns.  "Speaking of the existing
structure of society," he continued, "Don and I
got into a religious discussion.  That is, I found
myself holding a brief for the proposition, which
I had read somewhere or other, that religion and
capital are in alliance against every-day men and
women, in order to preserve existing social
conditions.  Don't look so shocked, father.  There are
two sides to every question, and I was curious to
see how Don would look at this."
</p>

<p>
"And how did he look at it?" inquired Mr. Howard,
coldly, seeing that he was expected to
display interest.
</p>

<p>
"He wouldn't deny that there was some truth
in the proposition, but he agreed with you, father,
that whatever else is true or false, the world will
never be able to dispense with religion.  But he
says, too, that it must be sensible religion.  Just
what you said, isn't it?  And when two such intelligent
individuals come to the same conclusion, it
is time for a sceptic like myself to take off his hat
to the church.  You heard me just now concede
that the Rev. Mr. Prentiss is not at all a bad
lot."
</p>

<p>
"Paul, you are sometimes incorrigible.  You
have common sense when it comes to action, I
admit, but you have a perverse fondness for
harboring all the philosophical sewage of the age.  I
trust that your friend Perry brought you up with
a round turn."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he did," said Paul, with mock meekness,
as he sorted his documents.  "We must get to
work or else I'd tell you about it.  He was very
interesting.  As to aggregations of capital, Don
was highly conservative too.  He recognizes that
they will last far beyond our time.  For a seeker
after ultimate truth, I thought that extremely
reasonable."  Whereupon Paul indulged in a laugh
of bubbling, melodious mirth.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Howard made no comment, but threw the
butt of his cigar into the fire-place with the
emphasis of one expelling folly by the scruff of the
neck, and composed his features for business.

<p>
Constance consented to be taught typewriting
and stenography at the expense of
Mrs. Randolph Wilson.  She decided that to
refuse an offer which would enable her presently to
become self-supporting would be false pride.  She
acknowledged as sound, under her present circumstances,
Mr. Prentiss's assertion that it was no less
the duty of the unfortunate to accept bounty within
proper limits than of the prosperous to give.  She
consented also at his instance to call upon her
benefactress.
</p>

<p>
Any encouragement on the part of Constance
would have induced Mr. Prentiss to raise a
subscription to pay off the second mortgage on the
house incurred by Emil, and thus provide her with
a home.  But at the first hint of such a thing she
shook her head decisively.  A very different
thought was in her mind.  Emil was still alive and
liable for the bills which he had incurred for the
expenses of the canvass, but she felt that the six
hundred dollars which he had withheld from his
client as an enforced loan must be paid at once or
the good name of her children would be tarnished.
His appropriation of this money on the eve of his
disappearance was damning in its suggestion; but
she had thankfully adopted and was clinging
tenaciously to the explanation proffered by one of the
easy-going and good-natured co-tenants of the office
occupied by her husband, that the money had been
borrowed to carry out a speculation, and that Emil
had meant to return it.  Did not the broker's
report of the purchase and sale, found among the
papers in Emil's desk, support this?  She realized
fully that from the mere stand-point of legal
responsibility his motive was immaterial.  But with
her knowledge of his characteristics and of the past
she felt that she had the right to insist on the
theory that he had been led astray by sanguine
anticipations which, as usual, had been
disappointed.  His conduct had been weak and
miserable, and exposed him to obloquy, but it was not
the same as deliberate theft.  As a mother, she
was solicitous to treat the transaction as a loan
and to repay it without delay.  The world might
not discriminate, but for herself and for the
children the distinction was essential.
</p>

<p>
Having been informed how matters stood, and
that there was probably still some small value left
in the house over and above the two mortgages,
she thought she saw an opportunity to discharge
this vital obligation.  Accordingly, when she found
that the clergyman was still considering means for
rescuing her home, she disclosed her theory and
her purpose.
</p>

<p>
"My husband borrowed that money, Mr. Prentiss.
He expected to be able to return it.  I am
sure of this.  It was just like him.  People think
it was something worse because of what was in the
newspapers.  But, guilty as he was, he would not
have done that.  This being so, I am anxious to
have the mortgages foreclosed, or whatever is
necessary done, and to have what is left returned
to the woman whose money he borrowed.  It was
six hundred dollars, and there is the interest.  You
told me you thought there would be over five hundred
left, if the mortgagee was disposed to be reasonable."
</p>

<p>
Although Mr. Prentiss may have had doubts
whether Emil Stuart was entitled to the distinction
drawn by his wife, he understood and admired her
solicitude.  "I see," he said.  "I am told that the
value of real estate in the neighborhood of your
house has improved somewhat, and that you ought
to get at least five hundred dollars.  But in any
event the money which your husband borrowed
shall be returned.  You need give yourself no
further concern as to this; I will see that it is
done."
</p>

<p>
Constance shook her head again.  "It wouldn't
be the same if anyone else were to pay it," she said
directly.
</p>

<p>
"So it would not.  You are right," he replied
with equal promptness, admitting the accuracy of
her perception, which had confounded his too glib
generosity.  "Unless you paid it, you would feel
that you had no right to consider that the money
had been borrowed."
</p>

<p>
"Though I am certain of it."
</p>

<p>
"Precisely&mdash;precisely.  I understood what you
desired, and it was unintelligent of me to bungle."  A
confession of lack of intelligence by Mr. Prentiss
signified not merely deliberate self-mortification,
but was offered as a tribute to the mental
quality of his visitor.  He had chosen a word
which would have been wasted on or misinterpreted
by the ordinary applicant for counsel, that he
might let her perceive that he was alive to the
nicety of her spiritual intuitions.  They were at
his house&mdash;in his comfortable, attractive library&mdash;and
he understood now that the object of her call
had been conscientious eagerness to discharge this
debt.  There was nothing for him to do but
acquiesce in her requirements, and to thank God for
this manifestation of grace.  This quiet, simple
directness, which separated the right from the
wrong with unswerving precision, proceeding from
the lips and eyes of this pale but interesting woman
in faded garb, was fresh and invigorating testimony
to the vitality of the human soul exposed to
the stress of sordid, workaday realities and
unassisted by the choicer blessings of civilization.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Prentiss pressed her hand with a new
warmth as he bade her good-by.  "You must come
to see me often," he said.  "Not for your needs
only, but for mine.  It helps me to talk with you.
And I shall keep my eye on you and see that you
get work."
</p>

<p>
As the upshot of this conversation, Constance
surrendered her house to the mortgagee and
received six hundred and fifty dollars for her
interest in the equity.  The small sum remaining after
the claim of Emil's client had been satisfied was
supplemented presently by the sale of that portion
of the furniture unavailable in the tenement into
which she moved, so that she had about a hundred
dollars saved from the wreck of her former
fortunes.  The tenement consisted of two sunny
rooms in a new apartment house for people of
humble means, built by a real estate investor with
progressive business instincts from plans suggested
by the Home Beautifying Society of Benham, an
aggregation of philanthropic spirits, of which
Mrs. Wilson was one of the vice-presidents.  Here light,
the opportunity for cleanliness, and some modern
fixtures, including a fire-escape, were obtainable at
a moderate rental; and while the small suites were
monotonous from their number and uniformity,
their occupants could fitly regard them as a
paradise compared with the old-fashioned homes for
the poor supervised solely by the dull mercy of
unenlightened landlords.  Though this was a
business enterprise, the owner had felt at liberty even
to give some artistic touches to the exterior, and
altogether it could be said that the investment
represented a model hive of modern workingmen's
homes from the point of view of Benham's, and
hence American philanthropic commercial
aspiration.  The structure&mdash;Lincoln Chambers, it was
called&mdash;was on the confines of the poorer section
of the city where, owing to the spread of trade, the
expansion of the homes of the people was forced
further to the south.  From two of her windows
Constance looked out on vacant lands but half
redeemed from the grasp of nature, a prospect
littered with the unsightly disorder of a neighborhood
in the throes of confiscation by a metropolis;
but the mongrel character of the vicinity was to
her more than atoned for by the fresh air and the
wide expanse of horizon.  Her home was on the
eighth story&mdash;there were ten stories in all&mdash;and on
the roof there was an arrangement of space for
drying clothes which seemed to bring her much
closer to the impenetrable blue of the sky.  As
under the influence of this communion she gave
rein to introspection and fancy, her thoughts
harbored for the moment chiefly thankfulness.  The
stress of her plight had been relieved.  Discriminating
kindness had enabled her to get a fresh hold
on life without loss of her self-respect.  What
mattered it that her social lot must be obscure, and
that she had become one of the undistinguishable
many whose identity was lost in this towering
combination of small and uniform tenements?  She
had still a roof over her children's heads and a
legitimate prospect of being able to support them
without accepting the bitter bread of charity.  Yes,
she had become one of the humblest of human
strugglers, but her abounding interest in these two
dear possessions made not only her duty plain but
her opportunity inspiring and almost golden.  The
mortification and anguish of the past she would
never be able to forget entirely, but she would
make the most of this new chance for world-service
and happiness.
</p>

<p>
It had been necessary to sign some papers in
order to convey her interest in the equity of her
house, and she went for the purpose to the office
of the mortgagee's lawyer.  He was a young man,
somewhat over thirty, with a noticeably frank face
and lucid utterance and kind, intelligent eyes.  As
he handed her the six hundred and fifty dollars it
occurred to her that she would like to employ him
to satisfy Emil's obligation.  She preferred not to
have a personal interview with the creditor lest
she be obliged to listen to recriminations against
her husband, and she was loth to bother Mr. Prentiss.
So she broached the matter, stating briefly
that it was a debt which her husband had intended
to pay before his departure.  She had already
discovered when the papers were signed that the
attorney was aware that she had been deserted, and
neither did she supply nor did he seek enlightenment
beyond the bare explanation offered.  Nevertheless,
it was obvious to Constance, despite his
professional reserve, that he was alive to the
import of the transaction for which she was employing
him, and that it had inspired in him more than
a mere business interest.  There was a gentle
deference in his manner which seemed to suggest
that he knew he was charged with a delicate
mission and that he would fulfil it scrupulously.  She
liked the straightforward simplicity of his address,
which was both emphasized and illuminated by
the intelligent, amiable glint of his eyes which
indicated independence and humor, as well as
probity.  As she rose to go, Constance realized
that she had forgotten his name, and was on the
point of opening the receipt for the money which
he had given her, in order to ascertain it, when
he reached out and taking some cards from one
of the pigeon-holes of his desk handed them to her.
</p>

<p>
"I shall write to you the result of my interview,
Mrs. Stuart, and send you a written discharge.
Here are a few of my business cards.  I hope that
none of your neighbors will need the assistance
of a lawyer, but if they do, that is my profession,
and I intend to do the best I can for my clients."
</p>

<p>
There was a pleasant earnestness in his tone
which saved his speech from the effect of mere
solicitation.  It seemed to Constance as though he
had said not merely that he was eager to get on,
but that he stood ready to help those who like
herself had need to bring their small affairs to a
sympathetic and upright counsellor.  She had asked
him previously what his charge would be for
securing a release of the claim against Emil.  He had
hesitated for a moment and she had been apprehensive
lest he might say that it would be nothing,
but he had replied that it would be three dollars.
</p>

<p>
She glanced at the cards and read the name&mdash;Gordon
Perry, Attorney and Counsellor-at-Law,
144 Baker St.  Their interview had been in an
inner office&mdash;a room of moderate size, near the
roof of a modern building, with a fine view,
eclipsing that of her own flat, and furnished, besides a
couple of chairs, with rows of law books and a few
large photographs of legal celebrities.  On the
way out she passed through the general office,
where there were more chairs, several of them
occupied by visitors who had been waiting for her
interview to come to an end, more shelves of books,
and two or three desks, at one of which a woman
type-writer was sitting at work.  The click of the
machine sounded melodiously in Constance's ears,
and she turned her glance in that direction, in
wistful anticipation of the time when she would have
similar employment.  On her arrival her gaze had
been introspective, but now that her errand was
over she felt the inclination to observe external
things.  As she closed the outer door she saw that
the glass panel bore a painted inscription similar
to that of the card&mdash;Gordon Perry, Attorney and
Counsellor-at-Law.  She reflected that he had been
courteous and sympathetic to her, and she felt
sure that he was to be trusted, notwithstanding the
rude shock which Emil's perfidy had given to her
faith in her own powers of discrimination.  There
are some dispositions which are turned to gall and
forever charged with suspicion by a great shock
to love and faith as sweet milk turns to vinegar
at the clap of a thunder-storm.  There are others
whose horizon is cleared by the bitterness of the
blow, and who, partly from humility, partly from
an instinctive revolt against the doctrine of despair,
readjust their perspectives and harbor still the
god-like belief that they can know good from evil.
</p>

<p>
Preliminary to beginning her lessons, Constance
had still her call to make on Mrs. Wilson.  The
new fashionable quarter of Benham, beyond the
river Nye, was scarcely more than a name to her,
though, especially in the early days of her
marriage, she had from time to time included this in
her Sabbath saunterings with her husband, and
she remembered Emil's having pointed out in
terms of irony the twin mansions of Mr. Carleton
Howard and his sister in process of erection.  She
had not felt envious, but when Emil, after
inveighing against the extravagance of millionaires,
had with characteristic inconsistency, as they stood
gazing at the walls of these modern palaces,
asserted that he intended some day to have a house
of this kind, she had wondered what it would be
like, and had contrasted for a moment the lives of
the dwellers in this locality with her own, with a
sudden appreciation of the power of material
circumstances and a wistful curiosity to be translated
into an experience which should include white-aproned
maids, drawing-room draperies, and a
private equipage as daily accessories.  She had
silently wondered, too, pondering without abetting
her husband's caustic cue, how this contrast was to
be reconciled with what she had been taught of
American notions of social uniformity and the
subordination of the unnecessary vanities and
splendor of life to spiritual considerations.  It was
puzzling, and yet the manifestations of these
discrepancies were apparently in good repute and
becoming more obvious as the city grew in
population and importance.
</p>

<p>
It is the personal equation in this world which
forces truths most clearly upon our attention.  So
it was that Constance on her way to Mrs. Wilson's
was fully alive to the fact&mdash;not bitterly, but
philosophically and equably&mdash;that, despite the theory
of democratic social institutions which she had
imbibed, actual conditions in Benham were repeating
the old-world distinctions between the powerful
and the lowly, the rich and the impecunious.  There
was no blinking the knowledge that she was living
obscurely in a flat on the lookout for the bare
necessaries of existence, while the woman she was
going to see was a woman of wealth and importance,
to whom she was beholden for the opportunity
of a new start.  Obviously, the American
experiment had not succeeded in doing away with
the distinctions between rich and poor, though
patriotic school-books had given her to understand
that there were none, or rather that such as existed
were spiritual and in favor of people of humble
means.  Constance could be sardonic if she chose,
but like most women she had little taste for irony.
On the other hand, she had a yearning to see things
clearly which her misfortunes had only served to
intensify.
</p>

<p>
As she entered Mrs. Wilson's house a new emotion
superseded this consciousness of contrast.  She
had expected to be somewhat edified by the decorations
and upholsteries, and had felt a mild curiosity
regarding them.  But she was wholly unprepared
for the superb and spacious surroundings in which
she found herself.  She walked bewildered
through the august hall behind the solemn, fastidious
man-servant, who, when she had disclosed her
name and errand, ushered her into the reception-room,
which served as an ante-chamber to the vista
of elegant connecting drawing-rooms.  While she
waited for Mrs. Wilson she sat gazing with
surprise and admiration at the costly and elaborate
furnishings and ornaments.  It was not that such
things were beyond the experience of her
imagination at least, for, though she had never been
abroad, she felt familiar, through books, with the
appearance of splendid houses.  She had seen
pictures of them, and was not without definite
impressions of grandeur.  But she had not expected
to behold them realized in the social life of
Benham.  If the discovery was, spiritually speaking,
a slight shock, it was a far greater source of
delight.  Neat as wax herself, but confined both by
poverty and early associations to sober hues, she
found in the close presence of these bright, seductive,
and artistic effects a sort of revelation of the
power of beauty which thrilled her deliciously.
Here was the culmination of the movement in
æsthetic expression of which, as revealed in shop
windows and on women's backs, she had for some
time been vaguely aware, but in which she had
been forbidden by the rigor of her life to participate.
The full meaning of this as an ally to human
happiness now burst upon her, and gave her a new
joy, though it emphasized the lowliness of her own
station.
</p>

<p>
The aspect and greeting of Mrs. Wilson gave
the crowning touch to her pleasure by adding the
human complement to the situation.  She was facing
a smiling, gracious personality whose features,
bearing, and gown alike were fascinating and
distinguished.  Constance felt no inclination to be
obsequious.  Her native birthright of unconscious
ease stood her in good stead.  At the same time
she desired to appear grateful.  She had come to
thank the lady of the house, and it was obvious
that the lady of the house was a superior
individual.  What a melodious voice she had, and what
a pretty dress!  How becoming her crinkly,
grizzled hair!  What an interesting expression, what
a sympathetic light in her eyes!  Constance noted
these points with womanlike avidity during their
interchange of greetings.  Mrs. Wilson asked her
to sit down.
</p>

<p>
"I have heard all about you from Mr. Prentiss,
Mrs. Stuart," she said, evidently intending by this
comprehensive remark to obviate for her visitor
the necessity of recurring to a painful past.  "He
tells me that you have shown great courage.  He
tells me also that you have left your house and
moved into Lincoln Chambers&mdash;the new dormitory
built under the supervision of our Home
Beautifying Society."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; it is very comfortable.  We get a glimpse
of the country from our windows."
</p>

<p>
"I know.  That is a conspicuous factor in its
favor.  Light and fresh air, good plumbing, pure
milk, a regular, even though small, supply of
ice&mdash;these are some of the invaluable aids to health and
happiness for all of us, and especially for those
upon whom the stress of life falls most heavily.
You can command all of these where you are.  You
have two children, I believe?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  A boy of seven and a girl of six."
</p>

<p>
"They will be a great comfort to you."
</p>

<p>
"I do not know what I should have done without them."
</p>

<p>
The pride of maternity encouraged by courtesy
drew from Constance this simple avowal of the
heart.  Though she was not unconscious that
Mrs. Wilson's friendliness was imbued with patronage,
it was sweet to open her heart for a moment to
another woman&mdash;and to a woman like this.
</p>

<p>
"And you have planned to pursue type-writing
as an occupation?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; I begin my lessons to-morrow, owing to
you.  I came to thank you for your generosity.  It
was&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I understand.  I am very glad that there was
something I could do for you.  I was interested
when Mr. Prentiss spoke to me concerning your
necessities and your zeal; I am even more
interested now that we have met.  I am told by those
best informed that there is steady employment for
accomplished stenographers.  It may be that my
own private secretary&mdash;a woman who, like
yourself, had her own way to make&mdash;will be able to
send for you presently.  My daughter is to be
married before long, and there will be errands to
be run and things to be done down-town and in
the house, if you would not object to making
yourself generally useful."
</p>

<p>
"I shall be grateful for any employment which
you can give me."
</p>

<p>
"I shall remember."  Mrs. Wilson smiled
sweetly.  She had felt her way decorously, but was
pleased to find an absence of false pride in her
visitor, who was obviously a gentle woman, though
lacking the advantages of wardrobe and social
prestige&mdash;as she reflected, a sort of Burne-Jones
type of severe æstheticism, with a common-sense
individuality of her own, and an agreeable voice.
"It will be a little discouraging at first, I dare say,
until you acquire facility in your work; but I feel
certain that in a short time you will be not only
self-supporting but happy.  A woman with two
young children can really live on very little if she
is provident and discerning.  It is the man who
eats.  Have you ever studied the comparative
nutritive properties of foods?"
</p>

<p>
Constance shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"I will send you a little pamphlet in regard to
this.  Many Americans eat more meat than they
require; more Americans are wasteful, and
ignorant of food values.  Housewives of moderate
means who approach this subject in a serious spirit
can learn how to nourish adequately the human
body at a far less cost than their unenlightened
sisters.  Cereals, macaroni, milk, bread and
butter, cheese&mdash;they are all nutritive and easy to
prepare.  If I may say so, you appear to me just the
woman to appreciate these modern scientific truths,
and to make the most of them."
</p>

<p>
It seemed to Constance that she had never heard
anyone speak more alluringly.  What was said
interested her, and she was pleased by the flattering
personal allusion at the close, but every other
effect was subordinated for her at the moment to
the charm of expression, or, indeed, to Mrs. Wilson's
whole magnetic personality as shown in looks
and words.  She had never before come in personal
contact with anything just like it, and it
fascinated her.  An admiration of this sort would
have promptly generated envy and dislike in some
women, but in Constance it awoke interest and
ambition.  Although she felt that she had stayed
long enough, she was loth to go, so absorbed was
she by the consummate graciousness and sympathetic
fluency, by the effective gown and elegant
personal details of her hostess.  She rose at last,
and, impelled to make some acknowledgment of
her emotions, said, wistfully, yet in nowise
abashed:
</p>

<p>
"What a beautiful house this is!  I have never
seen anything like it before.  It must be a great
pleasure to live here."
</p>

<p>
The frank artlessness of this tribute was grateful
to Mrs. Wilson.  "Yes, we think it beautiful.
We have tried to make it so.  Would you like
to walk through some of the other rooms?"
</p>

<p>
Constance was glad to accept this invitation.
As they proceeded Mrs. Wilson let the apartments
speak for themselves, adding only an occasional
phrase of enlightenment.  She was pleased with
her visitor, and divined that words were not
needful to produce the proper impression.  Constance
walked as in a trance, admiring unreservedly in
thought the splendor, elegance, and diversity of
the upholsteries and decoration, admiring also the
graceful magnetic woman beside her whose every
gesture and intonation seemed attuned to the
exquisite surroundings.  As they parted Constance
said:
</p>

<p>
"This has been a great pleasure to me."  She
added, "I had no idea that people here&mdash;in this
country&mdash;had such beautiful homes, such beautiful
things."
</p>

<p>
There was no repugnance in the confession, but
a mere statement of fact which suggested
satisfaction rather than umbrage at the discovery,
although the ethical doubt of the relevancy of these
splendors to American ideals was a part of her
sub-consciousness.  Mrs. Wilson's response gave
the finishing touch to this passive doubt.  That lady
had recognized that she was not dealing with dross
but a sensitive human soul, and had refrained from
didactic utterances.  Yet she felt it her duty, or
rather her duty and her mission combined, to take
advantage of this opportunity to sow the seed of
culture in this rich but unploughed soil by a deft
and genuine illustration.
</p>

<p>
"The spirit which has accomplished what you
see here can be introduced into any home,
Mrs. Stuart, and work marvels in the cause of beauty,
health, and decency," she said with incisive sweetness,
her head a little on one side.  "Because one
is poor it is not necessary to have or foster ugly,
inartistic, and sordid surroundings.  A little
thought, a little reverence for æsthetic truth will
not enable those of restricted means to live in
luxury, but it will serve to keep beauty enshrined
in the hearts of the humblest household&mdash;beauty
and her hand-maidens, cleanliness, hygiene, and
that subtle sense of the eternal fitness of things
which neither neglects to use nor irreligiously
mismates God's glorious colors.  We as a people have
been loth to recognize the value of artistic merit
as an element of the highest civilization.  Until
recently we have been content to cultivate morality
at the expense of æsthetic feeling, and have only
just begun to realize that that type of virtue which
disdains or is indifferent to beauty is like salt
without savor.  There is no reason why in its way your
home&mdash;your apartment&mdash;should not be as faithful
to the spirit of beauty as mine.  Do you understand
me?  Do I make myself clear?"  Her
mobile face was vibrant with the ardor of proselytism.
</p>

<p>
Constance looked at her eagerly.  "I think I
understand," she said.  "But," she added, "I
might not have understood unless I had seen this
house&mdash;unless I had seen and talked with you."  She
paused an instant, for the vision of her own
tenement as a thing of beauty, alluring as was the
opportunity, had to run the gauntlet of her
common sense.  Then she asked a practical question.
"If one had aptitude and experience, I can see that
much might be accomplished.  But how is one with
neither to be sure of being right?"
</p>

<p>
Conscious of these honest, thoughtful eyes&mdash;eyes,
too, in which she felt that she discerned latent
charming possibilities&mdash;Mrs. Wilson had an
inspiration which satisfied herself fully as she
thought of it later.
</p>

<p>
"There is often the great difficulty&mdash;also the
obstacle to those who labor in that vineyard.  But
in your case I am sure that you have only to search
your own heart in order to find the spirit of beauty.
After all, the artistic sense is fundamentally
largely a matter of character."
</p>

<p>
Constance went on her way with winged feet.
She felt uplifted by the interview.  Her starved
senses had been refreshed, and her imagination
imbued with a new outlook on life, which though
foreign, if not inimical, to some of her past
associations, she already perceived to be vital and
stimulating.

XI
</h3>

<p>
Three months later, on a rare day in early
June, Miss Lucille Wilson was made Mrs. Clarence
Waldo, in the presence of a fashionable
company.  Journalistic social tittle-tattle had
engendered such lively public interest that the
neighborhood of St. Stephen's was beset by a
throng of sight-seers&mdash;chiefly random women&mdash;who
for two hours previous to the ceremony occupied
the adjacent sidewalks and every spot which
would command a glimpse of the bride and guests.
A force of policemen guarded the church against
the incursion of the multitude.  Yet perhaps the
patient waiters felt rewarded for their pains,
inasmuch as the heroine of the occasion, after
alighting from her carriage, stood for an instant at the
entrance to the canopy before proceeding, as
though she were willing to give the world a brief
opportunity to behold her loveliness and grandeur.
For those with pocket cameras there was time
enough for a snap-shot before she was lost to
sight.
</p>

<p>
Within the church were gay silks and nodding
bonnet plumes and imposing formalities.  Six
maids, each wearing as a memento an exquisite
locket encrusted with diamonds, and six ushers with
scarf-pins of a pearl set in a circle of tiny rubies,
escorted the bride to the altar, where the Rev. Mr. Prentiss
and two assistant priests were in attendance.
When the happy pair had been made man
and wife a choir of expensive voices chanted
melodiously "O Perfect Love," and the procession
streamed down the aisle on its way to the
wedding-breakfast.  This was served by a New York
caterer on little tables with all the gorgeous nicety
of which he was capable.  Though June is a month
when most delicious things are to be had, an effort
had evidently been made to procure delicacies
which were not in season.  The effect of a jam of
guests elbowing for their food, as is usual on such
occasions, would have lacerated Mrs. Wilson's
sensibilities.  Her house was large, so she had been
able to invite her entire social acquaintance
without crowding her rooms, and her instructions had
been that there should be numerous deft waiters
in order that each guest might come under the
benign influence of personal supervision.
Accordingly everyone was pleased and in good spirits
unless it were the bridegroom, and the doubt in
his case was suggested only by the impassiveness
of his countenance at a time when it should
properly have been the mirror of his heart's joy.
Perhaps he had not fully recovered from the farewell
dinner given him by his stag friends, as newspaper
women are apt to designate a bachelor's intimates,
where he had seen fit to express his emotion by
drinking champagne to the point when he became
musically mellow, a curious and singularly
Anglo-Saxon prelude to the holy rite of matrimony.
Nevertheless, he was dignified if unemotional; and
his frock coat, built for the occasion, his creased
trousers, and mouse-colored spats were irreproachable.
</p>

<p>
When the hour came for the bride and groom
to depart there were so many sight-seers about the
door that the police had to keep the public at bay
in order to afford the happy pair a clear passage
to the carriage; and also to give the blithe young
men and women ample scope for the discharge of
the rice and slippers which convention prescribes
shall be hurled at those who set forth on their
honeymoon in the blaze of social distinction.  For
a moment the fun was furious, and, the contagion
spreading to the spectators, a cheer partly of
sympathy, partly of derision broke forth as the
spirited horses, bewildered by the shower of
missiles, bounded away toward the station.  Two
hatless, exhilarated youths chased the retreating
victims down the street, one of whom skilfully threw
an old shoe so that it remained on the top of the
vehicle.  When the young couple entered the
special Pullman car reserved for them the newsboys
were already offering papers containing full
accounts of the wedding ceremony, including a list
of the guests and of the presents with their donors,
large pictures of the bride and groom, and diverse
cuts reproductive of the salient features of what
one of the scribes designated as the most imposing
nuptials in Benham's social history.
</p>

<p>
And so they were married.  And sorry as she
was to lose her daughter, Mrs. Wilson was thankful
to have it all over, and to be able to settle down
once more and unreservedly to the schemes for
social regeneration which had shared with maternal
affection the energies of her adult mind.  To
a certain extent these interests had been rivals,
unconsciously and involuntarily so, but it has already
been intimated that Lucille was not the kind of
girl her mother had intended her to be, and lacked
the sympathies which might have made Mrs. Wilson's
interests virtually one.  To give Lucille all
which a modern parent could give and to see her
happily married had been her paramount thought.
This was now accomplished.  The child had received
every advantage which wealth could supply,
and every stimulus which her own intelligence
could suggest.  Lucille had not chosen the husband
she would have picked out for her.  Still Lucille
loved him, and since fate had so ordained it, and
they had become husband and wife, she was
determined to be pleased, and she felt in a measure
relieved.  The main responsibility was at an end,
and she could now enjoy her daughter's married
state, and was free to give almost undivided
thought to her social responsibilities.
</p>

<p>
Accordingly on the days which followed the
wedding Mrs. Wilson shut herself up in her study,
and with the aid of her private secretary proceeded
to dispose of her accumulated correspondence, and
to put her personal affairs to rights.  June was the
fag end of the social year.  Many of those who
had been energetic in social enterprises since the
autumn were now a little jaded and on the eve of
departure for the country, the Lakes, the Atlantic
coast or Europe, in search of that respite from the
full pressure of modern life which all who can
afford it in our large cities now endeavor to procure
for themselves.  Nevertheless it was the best time
to look the field over and to sow the seeds of new
undertakings by broaching them to those whose
support she desired by a short note of suggestion
which could be mulled over during the summer.
It was not the season to extract definite promises
from allies or to enlist new recruits, but essentially
that for exploiting ideas which might bear fruit
later when the brains and sensibilities of Benham's
best element had been rested and refreshed.
Mrs. Wilson had numerous charities, clubs in
furtherance of knowledge and classes promoting hygienic
or æsthetic development to be pondered.  For
some of these&mdash;the struggling annual charities&mdash;methods
like a fair or theatricals must be devised
in order to raise fresh annual funds.  The
progressive courses of the past winter, such as the
practical talks to young mothers, with live babies
as object-lessons, and lectures on the relaxation of
the muscles, must be superseded by others no less
instructive and alluring.  Then again new blood
must be introduced into the various coteries which
worked for the regeneration and enlightenment of
the poor to make good the losses caused by
matrimony or fickleness, and new schemes originated for
retaining the attention of the meritorious persons
to be benefited.  In this last connection the idea
of a course which should emphasize the importance
to every woman of learning something on
which she could fall back for self-support,
suggested by Mrs. Stuart's plight, now recurred to
her as timely.  And besides these public interests
there were the&mdash;perhaps more absorbing because
more flattering&mdash;numerous personal demands on
her sympathies and time made by other women&mdash;women
largely of her own, but of every walk.
Here it seemed to her was her most precious
vineyard, for here the opportunity was given for soul
to compass soul in an affinity which blessed both
the giver and the receiver of spiritual benefits.
Sometimes the need which sought her was that of
the sinful woman, eager to rehabilitate herself.
Sometimes that of the friendless, aspiring student
seeking recognition or guidance; but oftener than
any that of the blossoming maid or wife of her
own class whose yearning nature, reaching out to
hers as the flower to the sun and breeze, received
the mysterious quickening which is the essence of
the higher life, and gave to her in return a love
which was like sexual passion in its ardor, but
savoring only of the spirit.  If she were thus able
by the unconscious gifts or grace which were in
her to relieve the necessities and attune the
aspirations of these choice&mdash;and it seemed to her that
often the neediest were the choicest&mdash;natures, was
it strange that she should cherish and even
cultivate this involuntary power?  Mrs. Wilson's
theory in regard to this personal influence was that
it was the grateful product of her allegiance to,
and passion for, beauty so far as she could lay
claim to any merit in the matter.  She accepted it
as a heaven-sent and heaven-kissing gift which was
to be rejoiced in and administered as a trust.  Since
her talent had turned out to be that of a leader to
point the way by virtue of sympathetic intelligence&mdash;or,
to quote her own mental simile, the electric
medium which opened to eager, groping souls the
realm of spirit&mdash;was not the mission the most
congenial which could have been offered her, and in
the direct line of her tastes and ambitions?
Consequently her private correspondence with those
who sought counsel and inspiration in return for
adoring fealty was a labor of care as well as of
love.  Just the right words must be written, and
the individual personal touch imparted to each
message of criticism, revelation, homely advice, or
mere greeting.  To be true to beauty and to
maintain her individuality by the free outpouring of
herself from day to day in felicitous speech of
tongue and pen was her glowing task.  In the
pursuance of it she had acquired mannerisms which
were now a part of herself.  Her phrases of
endearment, her chirography, her note-paper, her
method of signing herself, had severally a distinction
or peculiarity of their own.  All this was now
a second nature; but at the outset she had been
conscious of it, and, though never challenged, she had
once written in vindication in one of her heart-to-heart
missives that the mysterious forces of the
universe through which God talks with man wear not
the garb of conforming plainness, but have each its
special exquisiteness; witness the moon-bathed
summer night, the mountain peak at sunrise, the
lightening glare among the forest pines, the lordly
ocean in its many moods.  She had a memory for
birthdays and anniversaries.  In the hour of
bereavement her unique words of consolation were
the first to arrive.  She was prodigal of flowers,
and her proselytes, knowing her affection for the
rose and the lily, were apt to transform her study
into a bower on the slightest excuse.  She never
wrote without flowers within her range of vision.
In the evening of one of these days following
her daughter's wedding, Mrs. Wilson was interrupted
in her correspondence by the entrance of
her maid with the bewildering news that a baby
had been left on the doorsteps, and that a woman,
presumably its mother, had, in the act of stealing
away after ringing the bell, run into the arms of
one of the servants, and was now a prisoner below
stairs.  The maid was agitated.  Should they send
for a policeman, or what was to be done?  The
course to adopt had not been clear to those in
authority in the kitchen, and the solution had been
left to the mistress whose eleemosynary tendencies
had to be taken into account.
</p>

<p>
An infant, a waif of destiny, left on her doorsteps
at dead of night!  There was only one thing
to do, to see the baby, and to talk to the mother,
and for this purpose Mrs. Wilson had both
brought before her in the ante-room where she had
received Constance Stuart.  Rumor flies fast, and
by this time a burly, belted policeman had arrived
on the scene and stood towering in the background
behind the quartette of servants, the butler, the
second-man, who had apprehended the woman, a
housemaid who had taken the custody of the child,
and Mrs. Wilson's own maid.  Mrs. Wilson surveyed
the group for an instant with the air of a
photographer in search of a correct setting.  Then,
with a smile of divination, she said, authoritatively,
"Now, Mary, give the child to its mother,
and when I need anyone, I will ring.  You, too,
Mr. Officer, please wait outside.  I am sure that
this woman will tell me her story more freely if
we are alone.  And, James, bring some tea&mdash;the
regular tea-service."
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-168"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-168.jpg" alt="&quot;I am sure that this woman will tell me her story&quot;" />
<br />
&quot;I am sure that this woman will tell me her story&quot;
</p>

<p>
As the servants took their departure, Mrs. Wilson
looked again at the woman, whom she had
already perceived to be young and good looking.
She stood holding her baby securely but not
tenderly, with a half-defiant, half-bewildered air, as
of a cat at bay in strange surroundings.  But
though her mien expressed a feline dismay,
Mrs. Wilson perceived that she was no desperate
creature of the slums.  Nor was she flauntily dressed
like the courtesan of tradition.  Her attire&mdash;a neat
straw sailor hat, a well-fitting dark blue serge skirt
and serge jacket over a white shirt, and decent
boots indicated some social aptness; and her
features, especially her clever and sensitive, though
somewhat hard, mouth gave the challenge of
intelligence.  It was a smart face, one which
suggested quick-wittedness and the habit of
self-reliance, if not self-satisfaction, to the detriment
of sentiment and delicacy.  She appeared to
Mrs. Wilson to be about twenty-three, and slightly
shorter than Mrs. Stuart, with a sturdier, less
flexible figure.  Her hair was light brown, and
her complexion fair, but she had roving dark eyes
which gave a touch of picturesqueness to what
might be called the matter-of-fact modernness of
her aspect.  They were curious eyes, almost Italian
in their hue and calibre, yet in repose coldly
scrutinizing and impassive.  Mrs. Wilson appreciated
with a sense of relief that here was no case
of sodden ignorance and degradation; for though
in such instances the remedy was more obvious, she
preferred to be brought in contact with natures
which drew upon her intellectual faculties.  She
believed herself modern in her sympathies, and in
her capacity as a philanthropic worker was partial
to the problems with which modern conditions
and modern thought confront struggling human
nature.
</p>

<p>
"Won't you sit down?  And perhaps you would
like to lay your baby on the sofa while we talk and
I make you some tea."
</p>

<p>
The girl, who was prepared probably for a
sterner method, yielded, after a quiver of uncertainty,
to the fascination of this gracious appeal;
pausing for a brief instant to examine the tiny
face peering from the folds of the knit shawl in
which the child was wrapped, but with a gaze
scientific rather than maternal, as though she were
seeking to trace a likeness or some law of heredity.
Then she sat down and raised her eyes to meet her
entertainer's with a glance bordering on irony, and
which seemed to ask, "Well, what are you going
to do about it?"  Mrs. Wilson noticed that her
hands, which lay in her lap, lightly crossed, with
the palms down, were long and efficient-looking,
and that she wore no wedding-ring.
</p>

<p>
"Is it a boy or a girl?" Mrs. Wilson resumed,
with disarming gentleness.
</p>

<p>
"A girl."  With a contraction of her mouth
which began in a bitter smile and ended against
her will in a gulp, she added, "I didn't intend to
have it.  I didn't want to have it.  I suppose you've
guessed I'm not a married woman."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I guessed that.  I see, too, that you are
in trouble, and my sole object in detaining you here
to-night is to give you all the aid in my power.
I'm not seeking to judge or to lecture you, but to
help you."
</p>

<p>
The girl regarded her with a matter-of-fact
stare, then said, bluntly, "I'd have been all right
now if your servant hadn't nabbed me."
</p>

<p>
"You mean if you had succeeded in abandoning
your child?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I was earning my living before, and I
could go on.  I guess I could have got back my
old place."
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;  Do you mind telling me why you
wished to abandon your baby?"
</p>

<p>
"That's why.  I've just told you.  To make a
fresh start."
</p>

<p>
"I see.  And it was chance, I suppose, that you
left it on my door-steps rather than elsewhere?"
</p>

<p>
"You're Mrs. Randolph Wilson, aren't you?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"I had read about you in the newspapers, and
all about the wedding, and that you were tremendously
rich.  When my child was born I hoped she'd
die; but, as she didn't, I made up my mind that
the best thing I could do was to let you look after
her.  But the luck was against me a second time.
I was caught again."  She laughed as though her
only concern was to let fate perceive that she had
some sense of humor.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson frowned involuntarily.  Yet,
though her taste was offended her curiosity was
whetted.
</p>

<p>
"But wasn't your&mdash;wasn't he man enough to
look after you and provide for the child?"
</p>

<p>
"I didn't tell him.  He doesn't know.  It wasn't
his fault.  That is"&mdash;she paused for a moment,
but her expression suggested solicitude lest the
naked truth should be disconcerting rather than
shame&mdash;"I took the chance.  Neither of us
intended to be married.  He travels mostly, and is
here only two or three times a year.  What would
he do with a baby anyway?"
</p>

<p>
The entrance of the butler with the tea things
was opportune.  It gave Mrs. Wilson time to
think.  Her experience of women of this class had
been considerable.  If not invariably penitent, they
had always shown shame or humble-mindedness.
Here was a new specimen, degenerate and
appalling, but interesting to the imagination.
</p>

<p>
While the servant set the glittering, dainty
silver service on the table at his mistress's side the
girl watched her and him with obvious curiosity
and a mixture of disdain and fascination.  Now
and again her roving eyes took in the exquisite
surroundings, then reverted to the face of her
would-be benefactress as to a magnet.  It seemed
to be the triumph of a desire not to appear worse
than she really was which made her speak when
they were alone, and Mrs. Wilson, still in search
of inspiration, was busy with the tea-caddy.
</p>

<p>
"I wasn't going to let her out of my sight until
I knew she was safe."  She nervously compressed
the back of one of her hands with the long fingers
of the other in the apparent effort to justify her
course, a consideration to which she was evidently
not accustomed.  "Wouldn't she have had a better
home at the expense of the State than any I could
have given her?  And there was the chance you
might take a fancy to her and adopt her.  She's
less homely than the average new-born young one.
You see I thought everything over, lady.  And
next to its dying that seemed to me the best chance
it had for happiness in a best possible world."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, but you mustn't talk like that.  It's hard,
I know, egregiously hard.  But you mustn't be
bitter," said Mrs. Wilson, with mandatory kindness.
</p>

<p>
The girl smiled in a superior fashion; it was
almost a sneer.  Her desire to justify herself had
been an involuntary expression.  Now vanity
intervened, vanity and the pride of smouldering
opinion.  "I'm not bitter; I'm only telling you
the plain truth.  I'm ignorant, I dare say,
compared to you; but I'm not so ignorant as you think.
I've thought for myself some; and&mdash;and all I say
is that this isn't any too good a world for a girl
like me anyway, and when a girl like me goes
wrong, as you call it, and has a kid, instead of
crying her eyes out the sensible thing for her to
do is to find someone to look after it for her."
</p>

<p>
"Which only proves, my child, that such a thing
ought never to happen to her."
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;not if she has luck."
</p>

<p>
There was a brief pause; then with an impulsive
glide Mrs. Wilson swept across the room and
transferred a cup of tea to the hands of this
wanderer from the fold of grace and ethics.  The girl,
taken off her guard, tried to rise to receive it, and
looked at her with the half-fascinated expression
of a bird struggling against the fowler.  Sitting
down beside her, Mrs. Wilson took one of her
hands and said, "Do you not understand, my dear,
that society must insist for its own preservation
that a woman shouldn't go wrong?  The whole
safety of the family is based on that.  That's the
reason the world has to seem a little cruel to those
of our sex who sin against purity.  Children must
know who their fathers are."  She had these precepts
in their modern guise at the tip of her tongue;
she hastened to add, benignly, "But though the
world in self-defence turns a cold shoulder on the
unchaste woman, for her who seeks forgiveness
and a fresh start there are helping hands and
loving words which offer forbearance and counsel and
friendship."
</p>

<p>
"But supposing I'm not seeking forgiveness?
That's the trouble, lady.  If only now I were a
shame-faced, contrite sinner down in the dust at
the foot of the cross asking permission to lead a
new life, how much simpler it would be for both
of us!"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson gasped.  The coolness of the
sacrilege disturbed her intellectual poise.  The
girl might have been speaking of an invitation to
dinner instead of the redemption of her soul so
casual was her regret.  "That is where you belong;
that is where you must come in order to find
grace and peace," she said, in an intense whisper.
</p>

<p>
"I've shocked you."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you've shocked me.  But that doesn't
matter.  You don't realize what you're saying.
The important thing is to save you from yourself,
to cleanse the windows of your soul so that the
blessed light of truth may enter."
</p>

<p>
The girl regarded her curiously, nervously
abashed at the impetuous kindness of this proselytism.
"That's what I meant by saying I'd thought
some.  If it's church doctrine you mean, you'd
only be disappointed.  It may help people like you.
But for the working people&mdash;well, some of us who
use our wits don't think much of it."
</p>

<p>
Though Mrs. Wilson looked profoundly
grieved, the spiritual melancholy emanating from
her willowy figure and mobile countenance was
charged with resolution as well as pity.
</p>

<p>
"It isn't merely church doctrine that you lack.
You lack the spirit of Christian civilization.  Your
entire point of view is distorted.  You are blind,
child, utterly blind to the eternal verities."
</p>

<p>
The girl's dark eyes grew luminous in response
to this indictment, but a deprecating smile trembled
on her lip in protest at her own susceptibility.
</p>

<p>
"What is it you want me to do?" she said at last.
</p>

<p>
"To begin with, I wish you to support your
child as a woman should.  You brought it into the
world, and you owe to the helpless little thing a
mother's love and care.  Will you tell me your
name?"
</p>

<p>
"Loretta Davis."
</p>

<p>
"And what has been your employment?"
</p>

<p>
"They don't know.  I don't want them to know.
I gave them as an excuse that I was tired of the
place."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not asking your employer's name.  What
kind of work was it?"
</p>

<p>
"I was assistant cashier in a drug store."
</p>

<p>
"And before that?"
</p>

<p>
"I answered the bell for a doctor."
</p>

<p>
"I see.  I don't wish to pry into your affairs;
but do you belong here?  Are your parents living?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't mind telling.  There's not much to
tell.  My father and mother are dead.  I was
born about a hundred miles from here and attended
the public school.  I had my living to make,
so I came to Benham about two years ago.  I had
acquaintances, and was crazy to go into a store.
But a girl who came from the same town as I was
going to be married, and got me her place to look
after the doctor's bell and tidy up.  He was a
dentist.  He lost his health and had to go to
Colorado for his lungs, and then I went to the drug
store.  That's all there is to tell, lady&mdash;that is,
except one thing, which doesn't count much now."
</p>

<p>
"You might as well tell me that also."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well, I'd been thinking of training to be
a nurse when I got into trouble.  I'd got used to
doctors and medicine, and they told me I had the
sort of hands for it."  She exhibited her strong,
flexible fingers.  "If I had got rid of my baby, I
was going to apply to a hospital.  So you see I've
got some ambition, lady.  I wanted to be of some
use.  I'm not altogether bad."
</p>

<p>
"No, no, I'm sure you're not.  I understand
perfectly.  And the baby shan't stand in the way
of your making the most of yourself.  I will
arrange all that."  Mrs. Wilson spoke with fluent
enthusiasm.  She felt that she had discovered the
secret of, if not the excuse for, the girl's
callousness.  Unwelcome maternity had interrupted the
free play of her individuality at the moment when
she was formulating a career, and as a modern
woman herself, Mrs. Wilson understood the
bitterness of the disappointment.  It gave her a cue
to Loretta's perversion, so that she no longer felt
out of touch with her.  She refrained from the
obvious temptation of pointing out that a nurse's
best usefulness would be to guard her tender child,
and broached instead the project which swiftly
suggested itself the moment she felt that she had
fathomed the cause of the culprit's waywardness.
</p>

<p>
"I know just the home for you; a little
tenement in the Lincoln Chambers.  The rooms are
savory, convenient, and attractive, and on the
opposite side of your entry lives an earnest,
interesting spirit, a woman whose husband has deserted
her, left her with two children to provide for.
She will be glad to befriend you, and you will like
her.  I happen to know that the tenement is vacant,
and it is the very place for you."
</p>

<p>
Loretta had listened with sphinx-like attention.
When Mrs. Wilson paused her eyes began to
make another tour of her surroundings, and at the
close of her remark ignored the theme of conversation.
</p>

<p>
"I never was inside a multi-millionaire's house
before.  That's what you are, ain't it?"
</p>

<p>
The query was queer, but not to be evaded.
"I'm a rich woman certainly, which makes it all
the easier for me to help you."  If this savored
of a pauperizing line, which was contrary to Mrs. Wilson's
philanthropic principles, she felt that she
must not at all hazards let the girl slip through
her fingers.
</p>

<p>
"If I'm willing that you should."
</p>

<p>
"Of course.  But you are, I'm sure you are.
You're going to trust me and to put yourself into
my hands."
</p>

<p>
The confidence and charm of this fervor
suddenly met with their reward.  Loretta had held
back from genuine scruples, such as they were.
Instinctive independence and a preconceived
distrust of fine ladies had kept her muscles stiff and
her face set, though she felt thrilled by a strange
and delicious music.  No one could have guessed
that it was only the habit of awkwardness which
restrained her from falling on her knees in an
ecstasy of self-abasement, not from an access of
shame, but as a tribute to the woman whose
personality had captivated her against her will.
</p>

<p>
"You seem to take a heap of interest in me,
don't you?"  The words by themselves suggested
chiefly surprise, but the sign of her surrender
showed itself in her eyes.  They were lit suddenly
with an intensity which overspread her countenance,
bathing its matter-of-fact smartness in the
soft light of emotion.  "I'm willing to do
whatever you like," she said.

<p>
If it be said of Gordon Perry, attorney and
counsellor-at-law, that he was loth to incur
the modern epithet, "crank," it was equally true
that he had ideals and cherished them.  He believed
in living up to his convictions.  At the same
time his sense of humor made him aware that to
dwell unduly on premeditated virtue is the
prerogative of a prig, and that it is often wise in a
workaday world to yield an inch if one would
gain an ell.  His form of yielding was apt to be
genial, thoughtful consideration of the other
man's point of view, a virtual admission that there
were two sides to the case, instead of flying in the
face of his opponent.  The modern American regards
this tactful moderation as essential to the
despatch of business, and prides himself on its
possession.  It is the oil of the social industrial
machine.  Also it is slippery stuff.  One is liable
to slide yards away from one's point of view
unless one plants one's feet firmly.  It is so much
easier to follow the trend than to resist it.  The
natural tendency of those not very much in earnest
is to woo success by dancing attendance on the
powers which are, both movements and men.  So
convictions become palsied, and their owners mere
puppets in the whirl of human activity.  For the
sake of fortune, fame, or oftenest for the sake of
our bread and butter, we subscribe to theories and
support standards which we suspect at heart to be
unsound, lest we fail to keep step with the class to
which we belong.
</p>

<p>
How to preserve his poise as an independent
character and at the same time avoid antagonism
with some of his new friends had become interesting
to Gordon Perry.  He had reached a point
where he had only to be quiescent in order to reap
presently a rich harvest.  His clear-headedness,
his quickness, and his common sense had been
recognized, and it was in the air that he was a rising
man in his profession.  People of importance had
taken him up.  It was known that he had attended
to certain matters for Paul Howard, from whom
it was only one step to the source of many
gigantic undertakings productive of fat fees.  To the
eye of shrewd observers in Benham he had only
to go on as he had been going, and attend strictly
to business, in order to emerge from the ranks of
his brother lawyers, and become one of the small
group which controlled the cream of the legal
business of the city.  Instead of bringing accident
cases he would defend them for powerful
corporations.  Instead of conducting many small
proceedings at an expense of vitality for which his
clients could not afford and did not expect to pay
adequately, he would be employed by banks and
trust companies, would organize and reorganize
railroads, be made the executor of large estates
and the legal adviser of capitalists in financial
schemes from which profits would accrue to him
in the tens of thousands.  It ought to be
comparatively plain sailing.  This was obvious to the
man in question as well as to his contemporaries.
He knew that his business was growing, and
sundry rumors had reached him that he had been
spoken of in inner circles as skilful and level-headed.
</p>

<p>
To indicate the current which ran counter in
Gordon Perry's thoughts to his appreciation of
these possibilities it will be necessary to refer
briefly to his past and to his mental perspective.
He was the son of a widow.  Also a soldier's son.
His father, a volunteer, had survived the Civil
War, and, attracted by the rising destinies of
Benham, had made his home there, only to fall
victim to a fever within a year of his coming.
Gordon was then eleven years old.  A policy of life
insurance kept the wolf from the door for the
afflicted widow so far as a bare subsistence was
concerned.  She had a small roof over her head,
and was able by means of boarders and needlework
to present a decent front to the world while
she watched over her sole treasure, her only child.
Her ambition was to give him an education, and
her ambition in this respect was neither niggardly
nor ignorant.  He was to have the best&mdash;a college
training&mdash;and to give him this it delighted
her to pinch and to slave.  When a woman's duty
is squarely determined by responsibility for a
fatherless son, it is comparatively easy for her to
be true to her trust to the extent of complete
devotion and unselfishness.  But devotion and
unselfishness do not include wisdom.  Happy for
him whose mother is a victim neither to superstition
nor to silliness, but sees life with a clear,
sane outlook.  Mrs. Perry was one of those
American women educated in the days of Emersonian
spirituality, when society walked in the lightest
marching order as regards material comforts and
embellishments, who were austere and sometimes
narrow in their judgments, but who set before
them as the one purpose of life the development
of character.  She was simple, pious, brisk, and
direct; setting great store on acting and speaking
to the point, and abhorring compromise or
evasions.  In her religious faith she believed, as
a Unitarian, about what liberal Episcopalians and
Presbyterians believe to-day.  Doctrine, however,
appeared to her of minor importance compared to
the pursuit of noble aims and the practice of
self-control.  She wished her son to care for the
highest things, those of the spirit and the intellect,
because she regarded them with sincerity as the
passports to human progress; and, though her
æsthetic aims were dwarfed, and human color and
grandeur may have seemed to her to smack of
degeneracy, the white light of her aspirations had
a convincing beauty of its own.
</p>

<p>
Under the influence of this training and this
point of view, Gordon went to Harvard.  There
he encountered a new atmosphere.  The old gods
were not dead, but they seemed moribund, for
there were others.  The college motto, "Veritas,"
still spoke the watchword of faith, yet the
language of his class-mates led him to perceive that
what was the truth was again in controversy.  The
Civil War was over, but the martial spirit which
had sprung into being at the call of duty and love
of country was seething in the veins of a new
generation eager to rival in activity the heroism of
its fathers.  It was no longer enough to walk in
contemplation beneath the college elms and
develop character by introspective struggle.
Truth&mdash;the whole truth, lay not there.  Was not useful,
skilful action in the world of affairs the true test
of human efficiency?  A great continent lay open
to ingenious youth trained to unearth and master
its secrets.  How was it to be conquered unless the
spirit of energy was nourished by robust frames,
unless men were practical and competent as well as
soulful?
</p>

<p>
Gordon listened to this new note with a receptive
ear, and recognized its value.  Hitherto he
had thought little of his body, which, like an
excellent machine, had performed its work without
calling itself to his attention.  Now he took part in
college athletics, and realized the exhilaration
which proceeds from healthful competitive exercise.
Through contact with his mates, and active
participation in the affairs of the college world,
he experienced also the still more satisfactory glow,
best described as the joy of life, which, partly
physical, partly athletic, had never been a portion
of his consciousness.  He was drafted for the
football team, and by his prowess and his pleasant,
manly style acquired popularity in the college
societies, that fillip to self-reliance and proper
self-appreciation.  If, as a consequence, he relaxed
somewhat his efforts to lead his class in scholarship,
which had been his sole ambition at the start,
he did not forget that he was a pensioner on his
mother's self-sacrifice; and though his rank at
graduation was not in the first half-dozen, it was
in the first twenty-five, and it could be said of him
that he looked fit for the struggle of life, the
possessor of a healthy mind in a well-developed body.
He was sophisticated, but his soul was untarnished
by dissipation, and the edge of his enthusiasm for
enterprise and endeavor was not dulled.  Then
followed three years at the law school, where in
common with nearly everyone he worked like a
beaver to equip himself for his profession.  There
all interests&mdash;it might be said all emotions&mdash;were
absorbed in contemplation of technical training.
But he was still under the shadow of the Harvard
elms, and the great world lay beyond, a land of
mysterious promise to his eager vision.
</p>

<p>
However clear-sighted and philosophical a college
graduate, his first actual contact with the
great world is apt to be depressing.  Society seems
so large and so indifferent; he is so insignificant
and so helpless&mdash;he who six months ago was a
hero in the eyes of his companions.  Especially is
this apt to be the case when one is translated from
the dizzy democratic heights of college renown to
a humble, humdrum social station.  It was no
revelation to Gordon Perry to find himself the son
of a hard-working, inconspicuous boarding-house
keeper, but it sobered him.  He was neither
ashamed of the fact nor dismayed by it.  On the
contrary, the sight of his mother's tired face and
figure subordinated every ambition to his loving
determination to conquer the world for her sake.
It seemed, however, a less simple matter to
conquer the world now that he was an unknown
student in a law office in a large city, with no family
influence or powerful friends to abet his endeavors.
For the first few years his lot was so obscure that
the contrasts of life arrested his attention as they
had never done before, though as a subconsciousness,
for he never outwardly paused in his efforts
to become indispensable to the firm of lawyers in
whose office he was.  He beheld acquaintances in
various employments, whose mental superior he
believed himself to be, put in the direct line of
preferment through pecuniary or social influence,
and had to solace himself with the doctrine&mdash;also
the American doctrine&mdash;that it was every man's
privilege to make the most of his own advantages,
and his duty to acknowledge the same privilege in
others.
</p>

<p>
Some young men are made cynical by the
perception of the workings of free competition;
others simply thoughtful.  Gordon was among the
latter.  Life presented itself to him from a new
perspective, and if it suddenly appeared both
perplexing and distressing, it appeared none the less
interesting.  His personal dismay, if this passing
reaction deserves so harsh a term, was transient,
but it was the precursor to graver, disinterested
musings.  His attention once arrested by the
inequalities of life turned further afield and became
riveted by concern and by pity.  Why in this city,
established under free institutions, was it
necessary that thousands should be living in poverty,
ignorance, and social ineffectiveness if not
degradation?  It ought not to be.  It must not be.  How
could it be averted?  This outburst of his protesting
spirit encountered the query of his dispassionate
mind&mdash;what remedy do you suggest?  It was
like a douche of cold water.  Instinctively he
reached out for help.  He knew that he was in
search of truth this time, but he abhorred an <i>ignis
fatuus</i>.  He began to ask questions and to read.
There were various answers on the lips of those
whom he consulted, for the question seemed to be
in the air.  Many, and there were among them
some whose broad shoulders, free carriage, and
prosperously self-reliant air told of that joy in
living and practical, world-conquering serenity
typical of the successful man of the present
generation, who assured him, often in a whisper, as
though it were a confidence, that these inequalities
must always exist.  Were not men's abilities
different, and would they not always be so?  Was it
just that one man's energy and skill should be
curtailed to keep pace with another's incapacity?
What would become of human individuality and
brilliancy if everyone's earning and owning were
to be circumscribed by metes and bounds, and we
were all to become commonplace, unimaginative
slaves of socialism?  It was right, of course, that
existing abuses in the way of long hours and
insufficient pay should be rectified.  That was on the
cards.  In many cases it had been already
consummated.  And what had malcontents or critics
of the existing industrial system to say to the long
list of splendid benefactions&mdash;free libraries, free
hospitals, free parks, and free museums&mdash;given to
the community by rich men&mdash;men who had been
abler and more progressive than their fellows?
Surely the world would be a dull place without
competition.
</p>

<p>
There were others who declared that the destruction
of the poor was their poverty, and that
the poor man was at fault.  That if he would let
liquor alone, have fewer children, and brush his
teeth regularly, he would be happy and prosperous.
They called Gordon's attention to the many
schemes for the uplifting of the industrial masses
which were already in operation in Benham,
homes for abandoned children, evening classes
where instruction and diversion were skilfully
blended, model tenements, and, most modern of
all, college settlements, the voluntary transplanting
of individual educated lives into social Saharas.
</p>

<p>
The books which he read were of two classes.
Their writers were either optimistic apologists for
the current ills of civilization, deploring and
deprecating their existence, and suggesting the
gradual elimination of social distress by education and
intelligent humanity&mdash;"the giving of self
unreservedly," as many put it&mdash;without serious
modification of the structure of society; or they were
outspoken enemies of the present industrial status,
alleging that poverty and degradation were an
inseparable incident of unchecked human competition,
and that these evils would never be eradicated
until the axe was applied to the fundamental
cause.  These latter critics had diverse preliminary
crucial remedies at heart, such as the capitalization
of land, government control of railroads, mines,
and other sources of power, or the appropriation
to the use of the community of a slice of abnormal
profits.
</p>

<p>
Most of this presentation, whether through
men or from books, was not new to Gordon; but
it had been hitherto unheeded by him and had the
full effect of novelty.  He found himself staring
at a condition of affairs which he had patriotically
if carelessly supposed could not exist in the land
of the free and the home of the brave until he
suddenly opened his eyes and beheld in full
operation in his native city, of which he was becomingly
proud, those grave contrasts of station common to
older civilizations.  These included on the one hand
not only the uneducated army of workers in Benham's
pork factories, oil-yards, and iron mills, but
an impecunious, shiftless lower class; and on the
other what was, relatively speaking, a corporal's
guard of wealthy, wideawake, luxurious, ambitious
masters of the situation, to whom he hoped
presently to commend himself as a legal adviser.
</p>

<p>
But what was the remedy?  What was his
remedy?  In the coolness of second thoughts,
after months of ferment, he had to confess that
he had none&mdash;at least none at the moment.
Simultaneously he had reached the further conclusion,
which was both a relief and a distress, that
whatever could be done must be gradual, so gradual as
to be almost imperceptible when measured by the
span of a single life.  He recalled, with a new
appreciation of the truth, the saying that the mills
of God grind slowly.  From the vanguard hope
of a complete change in current conditions, by a
series of telling blows of his own conception, he
was forced back to a modest stand behind the
breast-works.  Modest because he began to
examine with a new respect the philanthropic and
economic apparatus for attack already in position,
which he had at first glance been disposed to
regard as too cumbersome and dilatory.  Here was
where his purpose not to be quixotic and visionary
came to his support.  He realized that it was
necessary for him to wait and to study before he could
hope to be of service; that he must take his
position in the ranks and observe the tactics of others
before attempting to assume leadership or to
initiate reforms.
</p>

<p>
One effect of this check to his soaring
aspirations at the dictate of his common sense was to
give a fresh impetus to his resolve to succeed in
his profession.  For a brief period the shock of
his discoveries had been so stunning that he almost
felt as though it were his duty and his mission to
devote his life to finding a remedy for the ills of
civilization.  His mother's necessities stood as a
bar to this.  But with the ebbing of his vision he
found himself no longer beset with doubts as to
the legitimacy of his apprenticeship.  It seemed to
him clearly his duty, not only on his mother's
account but his own, to throw himself into his work
unreservedly with the intention of hitting the
mark.  He had his bread to earn, his way to make.
How would it profit him or anyone that he should
forsake his calling and stand musing by the
wayside merely because he was distressed by the
inequalities of the industrial system?  Inequalities
which existed all over the world and were as old
as human nature.  He had no comprehensive cure
to suggest, so for the time being his lips were
sealed and his hands tied by his own ignorance.
And if conscience, borrowing from some of the
books which he had read, argued that the prosperous
lawyer was the agent of the rich against the
poor, the strong against the weak, his answer was
that the taunt was not true, and his retort by way
of a counter-sally was that in no country in the
world did the laboring man receive so high wages
as in this.  This at least was a step forward, and
so he felt justified to follow precedent and to bide
his time.
</p>

<p>
In order to succeed a young lawyer must be
ceaselessly vigilant.  It is not enough to perform
faithfully what he is told.  There are many who
will do this.  The man who gets ahead is he who
does more than the letter of his employment
demands, who anticipates instructions and disregards
time and comfort in order to follow a clue of
evidence or elucidate a principle.  So he becomes
indispensable, and by and by the opportunity
presents itself which the shiftless ascribe to luck.
Gordon Perry revealed this faculty of indefatigable
initiative.  The firm in whose office he was
a student had a large business, chiefly in the line of
commercial law.  The transit of the various
commodities to which Benham owed her prosperity
was necessarily productive of considerable
litigation against the railroads as common carriers and
between the shippers and consignees of wares and
merchandise.  Besides, there were constant suits
for personal injuries to be prosecuted or defended,
involving nice distinctions as to what is negligence,
and bringing in their train much practice for the
juniors in the investigation of testimony.  From
the outset Gordon worked with unsparing enthusiasm,
seeking to do the work entrusted to him so
thoroughly that those who tried the cases would
find the situation clearly defined and everything at
their fingers' ends.  When it was perceived that he
was not only diligent but discerning and accurate,
they began to rely on him, and by the end of three
years the responsibility of trying as well as of
preparing the less important proceedings in the lower
courts became his.  Also, by showing himself
solicitous regarding the affairs of the clients of
the office, he was able now and again to supply
information or tide matters over when the
member of the firm inquired for was out; and it was
not long before some of them formed the habit
of consulting him directly in minor matters.  When
at the end of five years the senior partner, who
had independent means, retired in order to go to
Congress, his two associates came to the conclusion
that it would be good policy, as well as just,
to give Perry, as the most promising young man
in the office, a small interest in the business.  This
promotion naturally gave him a new status with
the clients, and most of those who had been in
the habit of consulting him offhand, now laid their
serious troubles before him.  So by the time he
was twenty-nine he was well started in his profession,
and able to extract a promise from his mother
that if he continued to prosper for another year,
she would yield to his solicitations to give up her
boarders and move into a brighter neighborhood.
</p>

<p>
Although absorbed in his profession, Gordon's
genial charm soon brought him invitations of a
social nature.  He became a member of a law club
of men of his own age, which met once a month
to compare impressions and banish dull care over
a good dinner.  Still eager for exercise he joined
a rowing club on the river Nye, and a gymnasium.
After he was admitted to the firm he had his name
put up for election at one of the social clubs, The
University, so called because its members were
college graduates.  Here he met the educated
young men of the city, and though his mother had
an old-fashioned prejudice against clubs, as
aristocratic resorts where men gambled and drank
more than was good for them, Gordon felt that
he needed some place where he could play a game
of whist or billiards with congenial spirits or look
at magazines in a cosey library as an antidote to
his sterner pursuits.  Mrs. Perry was more than
willing to trust her son, so she sighed and set
down to the changed temper of the day the spread
of Benham's club fever.  For, like other
progressive cities, Benham was fairly honeycombed with
clubs.  The American social instinct had become
almost daft on the subject, and no two or three
men or women could come together for any purpose
without organizing.  From a constitution and
by-laws the road was apt to be short to rooms or
a clubhouse.  The University was one of half a
dozen of the purely social clubs of the city, a
spacious establishment, modelled on European
traditions with American plumbing and other modern
comforts.  Gordon was prompted to join by Paul
Howard, who declared that he preferred it for
genuine enjoyment to the Eagle Club, the favorite
resort of the very rich and fashionable&mdash;the
Spread Eagle, as the malicious termed it.  At The
University there was secular instrumental music on
Sunday afternoons, a custom copied from Boston,
that former hotbed of ascetic Sabbath life, and on
Saturday nights a cold supper was provided, about
which stood in pleasant groups the active professional
and business men of the city and those who
followed the arts&mdash;musicians, painters, and literary men.
</p>

<p>
"Exclusive and aristocratic all the same," said
Hall Collins, contemptuously, one day when
Gordon vouchsafed to him a glowing account of these
Saturday nights.  Hall was one of the moving
spirits in the only other club of which Gordon was
a member, The Citizens' Club, the somewhat
ambitious title of an organization conducted by young
men interested in civic and industrial reform, not
unlike that to which the unhappy Emil Stuart had
belonged.
</p>

<p>
"Which only shows how little you understand
what we are after," was the prompt answer.
"There isn't a more truly democratic place in the
world&mdash;only we insist that a man should win his
spurs before he is entitled to consideration.  A
clod, while he is a clod, isn't a gentleman, and it
isn't good American doctrine to regard him as one.
No logic will make him so.  You're talking
through your hat, Hall, and you know it."
</p>

<p>
Hall grinned.  It was true he was not more than
half in earnest, but he was more than half
suspicious of Gordon.  He could not make him out,
which nettled him, for Hall Collins liked to have
men docketed in his mind.
</p>

<p>
"To Gehenna with your gentlemen!" he retorted.
"What use are spurs to a man who has no
boots to wear them on?"
</p>

<p>
"Hear, hear!" interjected two or three bystanders
whose attention was caught by the metaphor.
</p>

<p>
"It strikes me, young man," pursued Collins,
who had his chair tipped back, his feet on the
table and was smoking a fat cigar which one of
the aldermen had given him, appropriated by the
wholesale at a city banquet, "that you're trying
to ride two horses."  He was glad to have an
audience to the discussion, for he could not make
up his mind that Gordon was sincere in his
interest in the Citizens' Club, and he feared some
ulterior motive, political or quasi-philanthropic.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, that's just what I'm doing," answered
Gordon.  "Half of the lack of sympathy between
the educated and the uneducated, between capital
and labor, as you like to call it, lies in the
imagination.  What is there incompatible in being
a member of a club like this and wearing
patent-leather shoes and the latest thing in
collars?"
</p>

<p>
"It smacks too much of college settlements.  It
doesn't go to the root of things."
</p>

<p>
"But it helps just as they help, unless in the
ideal democracy you are aiming at there's to be
no place for the refinements of life, for soft
speech, gentle manners, and the arts.  In the
millennium are we all to be uncouth and unimaginative?"
</p>

<p>
"Score one for the man with the patent-leather
shoes, only he hasn't got them on," exclaimed one
of the listeners.
</p>

<p>
"You're beginning at the wrong end.  You put
the cart before the horse; that's the trouble with
you.  What's the use of decorating a house that's
going to be struck by lightning?"  With all his
prejudice and homely exterior Hall Collins was at
heart no demagogue or charlatan.  He was dead
in earnest himself and he wished others to be.  He
was conversant with the history of the development
of trades-unions over the world.  He was a
student of humanitarian reforms, and gave all the
time which he could spare from his occupation as
a master-mason to the furtherance of what he
considered legislative progress.
</p>

<p>
"Struck by lightning, and then there's no house,
only ruins.  That's not what you desire, Hall
Collins, you, I, nor anyone here.  We're all seeking
the same thing, and we're all groping more or less
in the dark&mdash;putting the cart before the horse,
may be.  But you haven't any panacea for what's
wrong more than I have.  All we can hope to do
is to make a few trifling alterations on the
premises&mdash;paper a wall or enlarge a flue&mdash;before our lease
expires.  The chief reason I joined this club was
that I might stop theorizing and wringing my
hands and get down to business.  We all recognize
there's plenty of practical work waiting for
us, so what's the use of distrusting each other's
theories or motives?  I've no Congressional bee
in my bonnet.  I'm not trying to climb to political
prominence on the shoulders of the horny-handed
Citizens' Club."
</p>

<p>
Hall colored slightly.  He had been harboring
just that suspicion.
</p>

<p>
"Good talk."  "Come off your perch, Hall.
This man Perry's all right," was the response of
several listeners.  The group was now a dozen.
</p>

<p>
Hall took his feet from the table, stood up and
put out his hand.  "It isn't because the boys say
so," he said.  "I'm taking you on your own word,
Perry, and you'll never hear me peep again.
You've the right idea; it's no time for speculating,
for there's lots of business to be done right
here in Benham.  And if I had a notion you might
be masquerading&mdash;well, there have been cases
where men in patent leathers and dandy collars
showed up strong in working-men's clubs, and the
only business they ever did was to lay and pull
wires."
</p>

<p>
"Some men are born great, some achieve greatness,
and some have greatness thrust upon them,"
said Ernest Bent.  "Hall was born great, but if
Don Perry wants to go to the Legislature why
shouldn't the Citizens' Club send him there?"
</p>

<p>
"That's so," said a second.
</p>

<p>
"Not until he wins those spurs he spoke of&mdash;not
if he's the man I take him to be," exclaimed
Collins, doughtily.
</p>

<p>
"Not under any circumstances.  I have no wish
for office.  I don't desire to be a politician."  Gordon
spoke eagerly.  The only thought in his mind
was to deprecate the suggestion.  It was true that
in looking over the field there had seemed to him
almost a glut of philanthropists, and he had chosen
the Citizens' Club as a more promising opening
than charitable work.  But his ambition was only
to be a private in the ranks.
</p>

<p>
"And yet," commented Hall, "what should we
do without politicians?  They are the only
persons who put things through, and laws on the
statute books are what we need.  Look at this
cigar."  He exhibited the butt end, which was all
that was left.  "The man who gave it to me helped
himself to a box, and the only thing he wouldn't
help himself to is a red-hot stove, but I didn't spit
in his face and I smoked his cigar, and I dare say
he'll vote for some of our batch of bills because I
told him a good story.  It's disgusting."  He
threw down the butt and trod it under foot.  "The
cardinal sin of the sovereign people is their
ignorance.  Will they never learn not to send dishonest
men to represent them?"
</p>

<p>
"You see that Hall is both an idealist and
practical," said Ernest Bent to Gordon.  It was
through Bent that Gordon had joined the Citizens'
Club.  He was his next-door neighbor, the son of
an apothecary, and had, while following his trade
behind the counter, read books on the science of
government, and the rights and wrongs of man,
with excursions to Darwin and Huxley.  As the
result of bandying opinions from time to time he
had taken Gordon one evening to a meeting of
the club, and subsequently invited him to become
a member.  Gordon did not need persuasion to
join.  It seemed to him just the opportunity he
had been looking for to espouse the cause which
he had at heart, by focussing his sympathies on
practical measures.  He recognized that the club
was not only a debating body, but aimed to be a
political force, and that many of its members were
expert and not entirely scrupulous politicians.  But,
on the other hand, in spite of the jaundiced views
of some of those who harangued the meetings,
Gordon discerned that a half-dozen men were
really in control&mdash;among them Collins and
Bent&mdash;and that they were guided by a sincere and
reasonably cautious ambition to procure scientific
reforms.  A little consideration convinced him that
he was glad they were seeking to wield political
influence.  It gave the effect of reality, of battle.
Academic discussion was a vital prelude to
well-considered action, but, after all, as Hall Collins
said, the only thing which really counted was law
on the statute books.  It suited his manhood to
feel that he was about to fight for definite issues.

</h3>

<p>
After eighteen months of prosperity the law
firm into which Gordon Perry had been
admitted was crippled by the death of one of the
two other partners.  The survivor, who was the
junior of the two, and decidedly the inferior in
mental calibre and energy, proposed to Gordon to
continue the firm on the footing of two-thirds of
the profits for himself, and appeared pompously
grieved when his former student demurred to the
terms.  Before he could make up his mind to a
more equable division Gordon had made up his to
separate and to practise alone.  While Gordon
did not have a very high opinion of his partner's
talents, he was grateful for his own recent
promotion, and was aware that his associate's wise
countenance and seniority combined would probably
avail to control the cream of the business&mdash;that
brought by managers of corporations and successful
merchants, both prone to distrust youth.  But
the plan of setting up for himself was tempting,
especially as he disliked the alternative of the
lion's share going to a lawyer of mediocre ability,
and when Paul Howard asked why he did not
take the step in question, and intimated that he
would befriend him in case he did, Gordon
resolved to burn his bridges and make the plunge,
or in more correct metaphor to hang out his own
shingle.
</p>

<p>
As he had expected, there was at first a slight
lull in his fortunes; but, on the other hand, he was
able to pocket the whole income, and even from
the outset he was reasonably busy.  Paul Howard's
promise was fulfilled.  All his personal and
presently some of the firm matters were placed in
Gordon's hands, and the two men met not infrequently
as a consequence.  At Harvard they had
been acquaintances rather than friends.  Their
contact on the foot-ball team had inspired respect
for each other's grit, but they were not intimate.
As the possessor of a liberal allowance, Paul had
belonged to a rather frivolous set, notorious in
college circles through lavish expenditures, which
included boxes at the theatres and suppers and
flowers for the chorus girls.  Though Gordon was
partial to comic opera himself, he had regarded
Paul as a high flyer, and Paul in his turn had
pitied Gordon as a good fellow spoiled by being
obliged to "grind."  When they met again in
their native city after a lapse of years, each was
impressed by the other's improvement and found
him much more interesting than he had expected.
Paul had toned down.  His spirits were less
flamboyant; he was gay-hearted instead of noisy, and
his manner had lost its condescension.  On his
part, Gordon had mellowed through contact with
the world and was more easy-going in his address,
and no longer wore the New England conscience
in his nostrils.  They met first by chance at a
restaurant at noon, and, habit bringing them to the
same resort, they lunched together from time to
time, and the favorable impression was
strengthened on each side.
</p>

<p>
Gordon interested Paul because the former was
so different from most of the men with whom he
was in the habit of associating, and yet was, so to
speak, a good fellow.  The true creed of most of
Paul's friends when reduced to terms, was
substantially this, that the important thing in life is
to be on top, that in America every one has a
chance and the best men come to the front, that
success means money, that money ensures enjoyment,
and that no one is supposed to be enjoying
himself or herself who does not keep feeding the
dynamo of conscious existence with fresh sensations
and run the human machine at full pressure.
There were necessary corollaries to this, such as
"the devil take the hindmost," uttered considerately
but firmly; "we shall be a long time dead,"
murmured jocosely but shrewdly; and "the cranks
may prevail and the crash come, but we shall be
under the sod," spoken philosophically, with a
shake of the head or a sigh; the moral of it all
being that the position of the successful&mdash;that is,
the rich&mdash;is delectable and intoxicating, and the
rank and file are expected to comport themselves
with patriotic and Christian resignation, and not
interfere with the free workings of the millionairium,
an ingenious American substitute for the
millennium.
</p>

<p>
The stock market, athletic sports, and cocktails
were the tutelary saints of this section of society.
They were habitually long or short of the market
from one or two hundred to several thousand
shares, according to their means.  They followed
feverishly the prevailing fads in sport, yachting,
tennis, polo, rowing, golf, rackets, hunting, horse
shows (as now, a few years later, "bridge,"
ping-pong, and the deadly automobile).  And after
exercise, before lunch and dinner, and on every
other excuse, they imbibed a cocktail or a whiskey
and soda as a fillip to the nervous system.  They
were dashing, manly-looking fellows, these
companions of Paul, ingenious and daring in their
business enterprises, or, if men of leisure, keen and
brilliant at their games.  They set great store by
physical courage and unflinching endurance of
peril and pain, and they would have responded
promptly to a national demand for troops in case
of war; but when anything arose on the political
or social horizon which threatened to disturb
prices on the stock exchange they set their teeth as
one man and howled maledictions at it and its
author, though it bore the sign manual of true
progress.  In short, life for them meant a bull
market, a galaxy of competitive sports, and
perpetual novelty.
</p>

<p>
In turning from this comradeship and point of
view to Gordon Perry, Paul did so guardedly.
That is, although he was not altogether satisfied
to follow the current in which he found himself,
he had no intention of being drawn into the eddies
by false sentiment or of rowing up-stream at the
dictates of envy and demagogism.  He was ready
to admit that the policy of high-pressure enjoyment
and acquisition might be ethically defective,
but he did not propose to exchange his birthright
for a mess of pottage and become pious or philanthropic
on sing-song lines.  As he once expressed
it to Gordon, some two years after the latter had
set up for himself, between the hypocrites and the
fools it was a comparatively simple matter to
charm an audience with a psalm tune compounded
of the Rock of Ages and the Star-Spangled Banner
until it passed resolutions against the rich and
in favor of the poor, which not merely confounded
common sense and subverted justice, but gave a
sort of moral sanction to the small lies, the sand
in the sugar, the dirt, the superstition and the
slipshod ways which distinguished the people without
brains and imagination from those with.
</p>

<p>
"We might divide all round," Paul continued,
"but what good would that do?  I might move
into a smaller house, sell my steam yacht and all
my stable, except a horse and buggy, and play the
Puritan, but what good would that do?  People
would laugh and my wife would think me crazy.
I tell you what, Don, we&mdash;I mean the crowd I run
with&mdash;may be a grasping, extravagant, gambling,
sporting, strenuous lot, but we trot square.  There's
no sand in our sugar, and when there's music to
be faced we don't run away, squeal or delude
ourselves.  But I've sworn off cocktails for good.  I
began yesterday.  And I'm going to keep my eye
on you, Don.  I don't promise to follow you,
but I'm interested.  When you get your plans in
working order let me look at them.  I may be able
to syndicate them for you, even though I have to
shock my conservative father in the process.  By
the way, do you happen to need a stenographer?
She's said to know her business.  And this one is
in your line, too."
</p>

<p>
Gordon had been conscious lately that his work
required another clerk.  "In my line?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  A tale of woe.  She's a protegée of my
aunt's, and needs a helping hand.  A widow with
two small children.  Good looking, too, I believe.
Mrs. Wilson has had her taught until she can play
the type-writer like a learned pig, and take down
your innermost thoughts in shorthand.  And now
the woman insists on being thrown down hard on
her own resources, like a good American.  We
haven't a vacancy, unless I invent one; and it
occurred to me that you must have work enough for
a second stenographer by this time."
</p>

<p>
"I'll try her."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks.  One good turn deserves another.
I'll tell my aunt that she ought to ask you to dine;
and then if you don't give her to understand that
her will is all wrong and should be drawn over
again the fault will be yours."
</p>

<p>
"Bankers may advertise their wares in the shop
windows, but a self-respecting lawyer may only
look wise.  He must hold his tongue until he is
consulted."
</p>

<p>
"Squat in his office, eh, like a spider waiting
for flies?  But you ought to know my aunt all the
same."
</p>

<p>
"I should like to immensely," said Gordon.
</p>

<p>
"She's not like the rest of the family; she
belongs to a different flight.  My father has brains
and force.  It's not easy to equal him in those.
He hasn't had time though to sort his ideas and
tie them up in nice white packages with crimson
bows or to polish anything except his wits.  But
Aunt Miriam goes in for the perfect life.  That's
what she has in her mind's eye.  You would suit
her to death, Don.  You ought to be pals.  She's
absorbed in reforms and æsthetic mission work,
and she has a fine scent for national tendencies,
and there's no telling but you might each get
points from the other."
</p>

<p>
Gordon laughed.  "You flatter me, Paul."
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't.  You're not alike.  You're both
aiming at the same thing, I suppose; but your
ways are different.  And you can't very well both
be right.  You may not be pals after all.  You
may disagree and fight.  Come to think of it, I
shouldn't be in the least surprised if you did.  A
pitched battle between Gordon Perry and
Mrs. Randolph Wilson would be worth watching."  Paul
chuckled mirthfully at the conception.  "I'm
not quite sure which of you I would back."
</p>

<p>
"And now you're enigmatic, not to say absurd."
</p>

<p>
"Wait until you get to know her; then you'll
understand.  I should only tie myself up in a
bow-knot trying to explain.  Her daughter's marriage
gave Aunt Miriam her head.  If ever there was a
case of disappointment, Lucille was one.  Aunt
Miriam had intended her to be a model of
æsthetic sweetness and light, a sort of Matthew Arnold
girl with American patent electrical improvements,
but she must have been changed at birth.
Lucille has her good points&mdash;I'm fond of her&mdash;but
it's a matter of utter indifference to her
whether the world improves or not provided she
has what she likes.  She must have been a constant
jar to her mother.  Yet I never heard a whimper
from Mrs. Wilson.  My aunt had no particular
use for Clarence Waldo; yet when the thing was
settled one could never have guessed from her
manner that she was not to be the mother-in-law
of Lord Rosebery or of the author of the great
American novel.  But now that her mission as a
mother is fulfilled, look out for storm centres in
the upper lake region of high ideas and fresh
winds in reform circles.  By the way, the Waldos
are in this country again, and are to pass the
summer at Newport.  My wife says that we are to go
there too, with a new steam yacht and all the
latest appliances for cutting ice.  So you see, I
couldn't play the Puritan and the American husband
in the same act."
</p>

<p>
As a result of this conversation, Constance
Stuart obtained employment in Gordon Perry's
office.  When she presented herself he recognized
her with surprise as the client whose scrupulous
purpose he believed he had divined, though she
had given no clue to her instructions.  He realized
that he was predisposed in her favor, so that she
scarcely needed the letter of encomium from
Mrs. Wilson, which he paused to read, chiefly
because of its chirography and diction.  He observed
that both her face and figure were a little fuller
than when he had seen her last, which was
becoming, and that she was more trigly, though
simply, dressed.  It was clear that she had risen
from the ashes of her adversity, and was
determined to put her best foot forward.  And what
an attractive voice and fine eyes she had.  As he
looked at her he said to himself that she was
qualified for the position as one in a thousand; the
sort of woman who would understand without becoming
obtrusive, who would be neither a machine
nor a coquette; and though she was a novice, the
endorsement was explicit on the score of her
capacity.  Gordon felt that she would give a new
atmosphere to his office.
</p>

<p>
Constance, on her part, was pleased to encounter
one not wholly a stranger.  Though she had
acquired deftness in her work, she felt nervous at
actual responsibility, and the memory of the
lawyer's kind eyes and frank smile gave her
assurance.  As she saw him again she was sure that he
would be considerate and reasonable.  Mrs. Wilson
had spoken of an opening in Mr. Howard's office,
where she would be one of a roomful of
typewriters, but she was glad now that this
opportunity had been offered her instead.  There would
be less excitement and less contact with the
hurly-burly of large events, and less chance for
promotion and for better pay in case she proved
proficient.  But, on the other hand, she believed that
she would find here a secure and agreeable haven
where she could do her best with self-respecting
faithfulness and support her children suitably.
As she arranged her small effects in the desk
provided for her, she concluded already that she was
very fortunate.
</p>

<p>
Just a year had passed since Constance had begun
her new life in Lincoln Chambers, and the impulse
of that new life may be said to have dated from
her visit to Mrs. Randolph Wilson.  From that
interview and that house she had brought away
encouragement and inspiration.  The text of the
value of the spirit of beauty possessed her soul
with the ardor of a new faith.  Suddenly and with
captivating clearness it had been revealed to her
that the external fitness of things is a fact and not
to be ignored, and that the purely introspective,
subjective vision sees only half the truth of
existence.  She perceived that she had been content
with rectitude, and unadorned plainness; that she
had been indifferent and blind to color, variety,
and artistic excellence.  It was as though she had
been nourished on skimmed milk instead of cream,
as though her diet had been a monotonous simple
regimen without a luscious ingredient.
</p>

<p>
To begin with, she had turned her thought to
her own home, where cleanliness and order ruled,
but where she had hitherto refrained from other
than haphazard efforts at pleasing effects.  Her
idea had been to be comfortable and decent, and
to let the rest take care of itself, but now the
ambition was awakened to impart taste to her
surroundings.  To her satisfaction she found that this
was not difficult to accomplish even with her
modest resources, as her mentor had predicted.
Her woman's intelligence and native refinement
reinforced her aroused interest, and by altering
the angles and position of her furniture, and by
introducing a few spots of color to enliven the
monotony of her rooms she was able to effect a
modest transformation delightful to her own eyes.
To plant flowers in boxes for her windows and to
arrange the few pictures she owned to advantage
was the next step.  The modern design of her
apartment lent itself to her efforts, as though its
newness, its modern tiles and its wall-papers were
in league against dull commonplaceness, and it
seemed to her presently almost horrible that she
had remained indifferent for so long to the
necessity of external appearances, absorbed in the
processes of introspection.  When she and Emil
had married her predominant impulse had been to
be a good, loving wife to him, and to make his
home inviting by her cheerfulness and tact.  The
new, clean house had seemed to her pretty in
itself, and she had taken for granted that the sets
of furniture, the carpets, and other household
goods, bought hastily, could not fail to set it forth
to advantage.  They were substantial, fresh, and
paid for, and in her happiness it had not occurred
to her to bother further.  To do so would have
seemed to savor of undue worldliness.  Now how
far away appeared that time of joyful ignorance,
and how foreign to her present sophistication its
artless outlook.  She had deemed herself cultivated
then, and later, in the stress of her misfortunes,
had cherished thoughtful simplicity as the essence
of personal refinement, the life-buoy to which she
clung amid the waste of waters.  By the light of
experience it was plain that she had starved
herself and eschewed as effete or unimportant that
which was wholesome and stimulating.  The same
impulse led her to take a new interest in her own
personal appearance, to arrange her hair tastefully,
to consider a little what colors suited her
best, and in various simple ways to make the most
of her own personal advantages for the first time
in her life.  Not in the spirit of vanity, but in
acknowledgment that she had too much neglected
the temple of the body.  And not only in respect
to beauty in the outward manifestations of
everyday life did she feel that she had been blind to
what existence offered, but where art touched
religion.  She was able to approach faith from a
new point of view; to wrap her naked intellectual
communion with the garment of the church
properties&mdash;to yield herself to the spell of the solemn
architecture, the new stained-glass windows, the
artistic reredos, and the vested choir of
St. Stephen's&mdash;without suspicion or doubt.  Her life had
lacked the impulse of art, and in finding it she
believed that she had discovered the secret of a
closer approach to God.
</p>

<p>
She sought by zeal to make atonement to Mr. Prentiss
for her past deficiencies.  It did not appear
to her essential to recant her errors formally;
indeed, she did not do so to herself, for in
respect to certain dogmas and supernatural claims
of the creed she had not disowned her independence
of thought.  That which she wished to disown
unmistakably was the coldness of her attitude
toward spiritual things; she wished her rector
to realize that heart was predominating over
mind, and that trusting, ardent worship had taken
the place of speculative lip service.  A sermon by
Mr. Prentiss came in the nick of time to further
this attitude.  It was on the essentials of the
religious faith, and he defined them as the spirit of
Christian brotherhood and love through man to
God.  Although he did not in terms disparage the
importance of the dogmas and traditions of the
church, the impression left on Constance was that
he had passed them by as embodying the
antiquated letter, but not the modern temper of
Christian doctrine.  To her eager imagination
the doubts which had harassed her in the past
concerning the truth of the miracles, and kindred
scriptural deviation, from the natural order of the
universe were reduced to trivial importance.
Instead of stumbling-blocks to faith, they had
become objects of secondary interest, to one side of
the high-road along which the Christ-life was
leading mankind.
</p>

<p>
How better could she manifest this change of
mood to Mr. Prentiss than by devotion to church
work?  She became a teacher in the Sunday-school
in the Church of the Redeemer, the mission
church connected with St. Stephen's, joined
once more a Bible-class under her rector's
instruction, and undertook to befriend some poor
families less fortunate than herself on the parish lists.
But her dearest service was to help to deck the
church for the great Christian festivals,
Christmas and Easter.  To arrange the evergreen and
mistletoe, the profusion of lilies and roses, humbly
and under the guidance of those versed in such
matters, but with devoted hands, gave her a
chance to ventilate the new poetry of her soul.
She had become enamored of the charm of flowers;
she delighted in the swell of the organ and
the melodious chants of the rejoicing choir.  Her
willing fingers quickly became skilful.  At the
second Easter she was even appealed to on minor
points of taste by some of her fellow-workers, so
that Loretta Davis, who was standing by holding
smilax, nudged her as a sign of congratulation,
for she had represented herself to Loretta as a
complete novice in such matters.  Very grateful
and inspiriting to Constance was Mrs. Wilson's
voluntary tribute on the same evening that she
had been of notable service.  Mrs. Wilson was
the presiding genius and lady bountiful of these
festivals, especially on Easter Day.  It was she
who said yearly to Mr. Prentiss, "Date plenis
lilia," and, acting on that cue, gave orders to the
florists to exhaust the green-houses of the
neighborhood, and to spare neither expense nor pains
to make St. Stephen's the most beautiful
sanctuary in Benham.  It was she who organized and
tactfully controlled the large committee of ladies
whose annual labor of love it was to dress the
church.  It was she who oversaw and checkmated
the commonplace intentions of the professional
decorators employed to fasten festoons and
clusters beyond the reach of ladylike gymnastics; and
it was she who originated or set the seal of
approval on the artistic scheme of design adopted
by the committee.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson had had several triumphs as a
consequence of the freedom afforded her by her
daughter's marriage, but nothing had given her
more satisfaction than the progress of Loretta
Davis's redemption through association with
Constance.  She had jumped at the idea of placing
the wayward girl in the opposite tenement, feeling
that the experience would be a blessing to both
women; that it would provide Loretta with a
sympathetic fellow struggler and example, and give
Mrs. Stuart the self-respecting occasion to help as
well as to be helped.  Still it was an experiment
until tried, the success of which could not be taken
for granted.
</p>

<p>
That their relations had become sympathetic
was due mainly to Constance.  In her present
mood the unfortunate girl seemed to have been
sent to her as an opportunity for Christian usefulness,
as a test of her own spiritual regeneration.
Here was the best chance of all to show her
changed heart to her rector.  Her recognition
from the outset that Loretta was distasteful to
her, and her shrinking not only from the girl's
attitude toward sin but from her smart matter-of-fact
personality served merely as a spur to her
own zeal.  She would win her over and be won
over herself; she would unearth the palpitating
soul of which Mrs. Wilson had confided to her
that she had caught a glimpse, and teach her to
reassert and develop her womanhood.  Help came
unexpectedly from Loretta herself after the ice of
acquaintance was broken and the two women
found themselves close neighbors.  Constance was
attracted by the keenness of her intelligence which,
though Loretta was ignorant and undisciplined,
was apt to go straight to the mark on the wings
of rough but pungent speech.  It conciliated
Constance to discover this trait, for she shrank from
self-deception as a moral blemish and one more
typical of women than of men.  The girl's
directness awoke an answering chord.  A clear head
removed half the difficulty of the situation, and
held out the hope that wise counsel would not
be lost.
</p>

<p>
Loretta made no mystery of her circumstances.
She told the story of her shame with matter-of-fact
glibness as an every-day incident in human
life, lamentable possibly on conventional grounds,
but not to be judged harshly by the discerning,
among whom she chose to place Constance.  The
thing had happened, and there was nothing to be
said or done but make the best of it&mdash;which now
included the baby.
</p>

<p>
"She wanted me to keep it, and I said I would,
and that I'd come and live here and see how I
liked it.  I shocked her and&mdash;well, I had never
talked with anyone just like her before.  She
seemed set on my living here, so I thought I'd try."
</p>

<p>
"She" was always Mrs. Wilson.  This was
Loretta's invariable way of referring to her, as if
there could be no question who was meant.  She
talked of her constantly, with an eager yet shy
interest, which promptly revealed to Constance
how matters stood.  Loretta had taken up her
duties as a mother and subordinated her own
wanton theories to please Mrs. Wilson.  This
was the bond which held her, not religion or the
qualms of self-respect.  Yet it was a bond, and
Constance recognized it as one to be cherished.
To hear this woman, so bold and indelicate in
every-day speech, ask questions concerning her
divinity with a shyness not unlike that of a bashful
lover was interesting.  Was not she herself under
the influence of the same charm?  Was not this
infatuation another tribute to the power of the
spirit of beauty?  Thus Constance felt that she had
a clue to her new companion's nature, which she
did her best to utilize.  So it happened that
Loretta went to church because she could catch a glimpse
of Mrs. Wilson from where they sat; and Loretta
took a new interest in her baby from the hour
when Mrs. Wilson sent her, tied up with a pretty
ribbon, a little embroidered infant's jacket bought
at a fair; and Loretta helped to deck St. Stephen's
at Easter because of the chance that Mrs. Wilson
would speak to her, as of course she did.  Constance
found herself a silent but zealous conniver
and accomplice; and it impressed her that the
object of devotion seemed instinctively aware both
of it and the girl's need, for every now and then
Mrs. Wilson would make the occasion by a few
words, a note, a visit or a gift to lift Loretta above
the level of her own devices.  For just as Antæus
gained strength by contact with the earth, Loretta's
spirit seemed to crave the inspiration of
Mrs. Wilson's gracious patronage.
</p>

<p>
Though slap-dash and over-confident in her
ways, Loretta was capable and quick to adopt and
to perform skilfully whatever appealed to her.
Her experience as a cashier in a drug store had
given her a lingo and a certain familiarity
concerning modern remedies, and she had a natural
aptitude with her hands.  Some of the maternal
hygienic niceties practised by Constance appeared
to amuse her at first, but as she became more
interested in her baby, she outdid her neighbor in
pharmaceutical experiments with powder, oil,
perfume, and whatever she thought likely to make
her child a savory specimen of babyhood.  When
the child was a year old, Mrs. Wilson made good
her promise that Loretta should be instructed in
nursing by securing her admission to a hospital.
At the same time she engaged another of her
wards, a responsible, elderly woman, to take up
her abode in Loretta's tenement, and it was
arranged that this custodian should also tend
Constance's children during their mother's absence
down-town.  How to guard her children properly
after their return from school had been agitating
Constance, and this plan was exactly to her liking.
She paid a small sum weekly from her earnings
for the supervision, and it was understood that
Loretta should have the same privilege after her
apprenticeship was over and she had become
self-supporting.  So it was that Mrs. Wilson felt she
had reason to be gratified by her philanthropic
experiment in Lincoln Chambers.

<p>
The zest of existence must be largely ethical
and subjective for the majority of us or we
should speedily become despondent or bored.  Contact
with life is necessarily so commonplace for the
mass of humanity, that, were we dependent on
personal participation in large events and dramatic,
splendid experiences for inspiration and content,
few would not find themselves restless and in the
mental doldrums.  Fortunately for our peace of
mind, most of us not only appreciate that pictorial
and world-stirring, or even exciting, affairs can
be the lot of only a fraction of mankind, but, by
virtue of the imagination, manage to impart to
our more or less humble vicissitudes the aspect of
an engrossing situation.  We recognize the relative
insignificance of the individual drama, but its
reality holds us.  Its characters may be few, its
scenery bare, its action trite and simple to other
eyes, yet each of us, as the leading actor, finds in
the development of a human soul a part which
fascinates him, and lends itself to the finest shades
of expression.  Whether it be a king on his throne,
or a cripple in his cot, the essential matter to the
world is the nice interpretation.  So, as the true
artist in a subordinate rôle forgets for the time
that he is not the leading actor, we refuse to be
depressed by the unimportance of our theatricals
and are absorbed by the unfolding perplexities of
our own soul play.
</p>

<p>
It is every American woman's privilege, according
to her tastes, to dream that she may become
the wife of the President of the United States, or
wield a powerful influence as a poetess,
humanitarian educator, or other exponent of modern
feminine usefulness.  In marrying Emil Stuart,
Constance had renounced the latter in favor of the
former possibility.  She had sacrificed all hopes
of personal public distinction, but there still had
remained the vision of becoming famous by proxy,
through her husband.  If this had never appeared
to her happy eyes as a bride more than an iridescent
dream, the idea that she would presently be working
in a lawyer's office would have seemed utterly
inconsistent with her scheme of life, and a
violation of her horoscope.  Yet, now that she was
established in this position, she found the
experience not only satisfactory, as a means of
subsistence, but interesting.  In the first place, it stirred
her to be down-town in the swift current of affairs
and a part of the busy crowd which peopled the
huge office-buildings and swept to and from its
work with the regularity and rhythmic force of
the tide.  Through this daily contact she discerned,
as never before, the dignity and the pathos of
labor, and gained both courage and exhilaration
from the thought that, though there were generals
and captains, and she was in the rear rank of
privates, the real strength of the army lay in the
faithful performance by the individual of that portion
of the world's toil entrusted to himself or herself.
There was attraction, too, in her employment,
though her task was but to register and reproduce
with despatch the thoughts of others.  The occupation
tested her accuracy, patience, tact, and diligence.
She must avoid blunders and be swift to
comprehend.  There were secrets in her keeping;
affairs upon the issue of which hinged large sums
of money, and often the happiness of leading
citizens, who were clients of the office; close legal
battles between mind and mind; domestic difficulties
settled out of court; and suits for injuries,
where the price of a life or of a limb were at stake.
Her lips must be sealed, and she must seem
unaware of the tragedies which passed beneath her
observation.  Yet the human element became a
constant, vivid interest to her, and now and then
it happened, as, for instance, when a forlorn hope
brought liberal damages to the wronged or the
afflicted, that she was taken into the secret by the
exultant plaintiff, and was able to rejoice openly.
There was, finally, her association with her
employer.  From this she had not expected much.
She was there to execute his instructions without
superfluous words or the obtrusion of her own
personality.  She knew, instinctively, that he would
not treat her merely as a machine, but she took
for granted that their relations would be formal.
It pleased her that, though this was the case, there
were moments, even from the first, when he let
her perceive that he regarded her as a social
companion.  To evince a kindly interest in her
personal affairs was simply human; anyone might
show this; but to talk with her on the topics of the
day, to call her attention to a book or an article,
or, as presently happened, to invite her opinion on
a question of legal ethics, was a flattering
indication that he considered their point of view the
same.  A difference in point of view is the most
insurmountable, because the most intangible,
barrier to the free play of human sympathy and the
social instinct.  It is the last great fortress in the
pathway of democracy; one which the besiegers
will be able to carry only by learning the password.
A free-masonry exists, from the cut of the mind to
that of the hair and coat, between those who
recognize each other, and not to speak the same
language palsies the best intentions.  Modest as her
introduction to Mrs. Randolph Wilson had made
her, Constance in her heart believed that she spoke
the same mental language as Mr. Perry.  But
would he recognize it?  That he did so not only
increased her interest in serving him, but held out
the promise of a new friend.  He might so easily
have passed her over, he who was so busy and had
so many acquaintances.  Yet it was plain that he
liked to talk to her, and that he availed himself
of opportunities for conversation.  At the end of
a year it happened that the other stenographer,
her predecessor, left Mr. Perry's employment in
order to marry.  As a consequence, Constance
became the senior clerk, and was given formal charge
of the office with a slight increase in pay.

There were moments, even from the first, when he let her perceive that he regarded her as a social companion
</p>

<p>
She would scarcely have been human had Gordon
Perry's complimentary interest failed to
inspire her with some degree of hero-worship.  Yet,
though she was presently aware that she had set
him on a pedestal, she felt that she had excellent
reasons for her partiality.  Was he not a clear-headed,
astute reasoner, as well as kind?  A
thorough, conscientious worker, who went to the root
of whatever he undertook, and prosecuted it
vigorously, as well as a gracious spirit with a sense
of humor?  If she did not reveal much of the last
quality herself, she appreciated and enjoyed it in
others, especially when it was the sort of humor
which championed truth against error and could
be playful or caustic, as the occasion demanded.
He was simple and approachable, yet he had
influential and fashionable friends.  Recently he had
made the acquaintance of Mrs. Randolph Wilson,
and was on pleasant terms with her.  Constance
had recognized her handwriting, and had been
apprised by Loretta of his presence at Mrs. Wilson's
entertainments.  Loretta had, what seemed
to Constance, almost a mania for the social
department of newspapers.  She knew by rote the names
of the society leaders, and was familiar through
reportorial photography with many of their faces.
Mrs. Wilson was the bright, particular star in this
galaxy of interest.  Loretta searched with avidity
for every item of gossip which concerned her
divinity, and took a hectic pleasure in retailing her
information.  Thus it happened that every now
and then she would exclaim: "I see that your boss
was at her last entertainment," the fact of which
was more agreeable to Constance than the
phraseology.  Loretta's diction was always clear, but
Constance, who wished to feel that they spoke the
same language, had often to bite her lips as a
reproof to her sensibilities; and, especially, when she
heard her hero spoken of as her boss.  It was so
wide of the truth regarding him.
</p>

<p>
Then there was his mother, and here again
Constance had cause to feel gratified.  Quite
unexpectedly Mrs. Perry had called upon her, seeking
her at Lincoln Chambers in the late afternoon
when she was likely to be at home.  While serving
her five o'clock tea, Constance had observed, with
interest in her personality, marked resemblances to
her son.  He had inherited her naturalness and
mental vigor.  Her cheerful directness, too, but
in his case the straightforward attitude was
softened by the habit of deliberation and garnished
by a more tolerant gaiety.  It was obvious that
Mrs. Perry maintained the integrity of her convictions
until they ran counter in daily life to his,
and in capitulating reserved always the privilege
to be of the same opinion still, which she exercised
with her tongue in her cheek, thereby betraying
her great pride in her son, and in her son's superior
wisdom.  She professed, for instance, to regard
his ideas concerning the new home in which he had
just installed her, and where she was keeping house
for him, as extravagant.  What was the use of
spending so much on mere creature comforts?  She
did not need them.  She had sat on straight-backed
chairs all her days and preferred them, and she did
not require a telephone to order her marketing.
</p>

<p>
"When I was young," she said to Constance,
"there was only one set bath-tub in a house, if any,
and no modern plumbing.  We carried hot water
upstairs in pails, and those who drew water from
the boiler poured in as much as they took.  But
there are so many labor-saving machines to-day,
that sheer laziness is at a premium.  Gordon
declares that I'm all wrong, and that more people
are clean and comfortable as a consequence.  Then,
as to the wall-papers and carpets and upholstery,
well, they're pretty, I can't deny that.  But,
somehow, it goes against my grain to see so many bright
colors.  Yet when I say it looks frivolous, Gordon
simply laughs.  So I've promised to hold my
tongue until everything is finished, and to let him
have his way.  He likes to have his way almost
as much as I do mine, Mrs. Stuart, and the
strangest part is that, though he doesn't always
convince me, I have a secret feeling that he must
be right."
</p>

<p>
Constance was taken to see the new house in one
of the outlying and more fashionable wards of the
city, which, as Mrs. Perry had declared, was
supplied with all the modern improvements and was
being furnished with an eye to artistic taste.  It
became evident that the old lady, despite her
misgivings, was very proud at heart of the whole
establishment, but that her satisfaction centred in
the library&mdash;her son's room&mdash;a cosey, spacious
apartment with tall shelves for his books and
various conveniences adapted to a bachelor and a
student.  As standing on the threshold, she
exhibited it to her guest with a shy pride, which
almost seemed to gasp at the effects disclosed, she
murmured: "It sometimes seems to me a wicked
waste of money; but I'm glad to think he's going
to be so comfortable."
</p>

<p>
Constance replied, "It's a delightful room.
Just the place, restful to the body and stimulating
to the spirit, which a busy man like Mr. Perry
ought to have."
</p>

<p>
"There can be nothing too good for him, if
that's what you mean."
</p>

<p>
"I heartily assent," said Constance, smiling.
"And I agree with your son that it is sensible and
right to surround oneself with pretty things if one
has the means."
</p>

<p>
"I guess that he must have talked it over with
you," said the old lady, with a keen glance.
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"Well, it's a wonder he hasn't, for he sets
store by your opinion on lots of things.  In my
day, compliments weren't considered good for
young people, but I don't believe from your
looks that you'll work any the less well because
I let you know what he thinks of you.  He was
saying the other day that he feared you must find
thumping on that machine of yours, week in and
week out, and taking down letters in double-quick
time, dull work, and I told him that a woman of
the right sort, with two children to support, had
no time to feel dull or to think about her feelings,
but was thankful for the chance of steady
employment.  You see I know something about that
myself.  You have your boy and girl to keep your
thoughts busy, just as I had him."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, indeed.  But it is a pleasure to work for
Mr. Perry.  No man is a hero to his valet, and
need not be, I suppose, to his stenographer.  You
won't think it presumptuous of me to say that he
has been very considerate, and that I enjoy taking
down his words because he is so intelligent and so
thorough?"
</p>

<p>
"There's no one who likes to hear nice things
said about him so well as his mother.  There's only
one fault about him, so far as I know, and that
may be cured any day.  He's a bachelor.  I would
move straight out of this house to-morrow in order
to see him well married."
</p>

<p>
"That wouldn't be necessary, I imagine, Mrs. Perry."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it would.  I should make a detestable
mother-in-law.  Gordon gets his clear-headedness
from me, and I know my own faults.  I shouldn't
be jealous, but I should wish her to do things in
my way, and she would wish to do them in hers,
so we should clash.  I wouldn't risk it.  But I'd
be willing to die to-morrow and never to kiss my
grandchildren if only he had a good wife.  I
should be very particular, though."
</p>

<p>
"I should think so.  I hope with all my heart
that he may meet a woman worthy of him."  Constance
was a little surprised by her own fervor.
Expressed in sound it seemed to her almost
familiar.  Then, without knowing why, she sighed.
Was it because she painfully recalled that marriage
was a lottery?
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Perry evidently ascribed the sigh to that
source, for after regarding her a moment, she said
softly, "It was easier for me than it is for you.
When I lost my husband we were very happy.
You are left alone.  You see my son has told me
your story."
</p>

<p>
"I am glad that you should know."
</p>

<p>
"But you are young, my dear.  Young and a
charming looking, lovable woman.  The right
man may come along.  Who knows?"
</p>

<p>
Constance stared at her in astonishment.  "My
husband is not dead," she said, a little formally.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know.  He deserted you."
</p>

<p>
"But he is alive."
</p>

<p>
"Gordon told me that you had not been divorced."
</p>

<p>
"I have never thought of such a thing."
</p>

<p>
"You know where he is?"
</p>

<p>
"I have not seen him or heard from him since
the day he left me nearly three years ago."
</p>

<p>
"Precisely."
</p>

<p>
"He is the father of my children, however."
</p>

<p>
For a moment Mrs. Perry seemed to be pondering
the thesis contained in her single word of
deduction, and her visitor's reply.  Then she bent
her shrewd eyes on Constance, and said with a
quiet pithiness of utterance, which reminded the
latter of her employer.  "I was not tempted to
marry again because I loved my husband, and
could not forget him.  But I've never been able
to convince my common sense that it is fair to
asperse the woman who marries again after the
law has separated her forever from the man who
has done her a grievous wrong, but to think it only
right and fitting for a widow to take a second
husband when the first whom she has loved, and who
has loved her, is in the grave.  If I were a young
woman on my death-bed, I expect I couldn't make
up my mind to beg my husband to marry again.
But I couldn't blame him if he did.  It's the way
of human nature, often as not.  It's hateful to be
lonely.  And why shouldn't the girl marry again,
who has been left in the lurch by a cruel man, who
has been false to the vow he took to support and
protect her?  Only the other day a rich merchant
whom my son knows, a man of over sixty, who
had lived with his wife for thirty years, married
again before she had been dead twelve months,
and they had a solemn church wedding.  It was
your clergyman, Mrs. Stuart, who married them.
I'd call it disgusting, except that some people said
he was solitary, although he had daughters.  But
to make fish of one and flesh of the other, isn't
just.  I'm an old woman, and the longer I live the
more I dote on justice."
</p>

<p>
"I remember now.  I know whom you mean.
Loretta insisted on reading me the account of it
from the newspaper.  I've seen him in church.  He
is one of the vestrymen."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it was a society function.  But I don't
judge him," said Mrs. Perry, sitting up straight
to emphasize her intention to be dispassionate.
"Men are queer.  His wife was dead, and he had
the right to ask another woman to fill her place.
But why, then, should anyone criticise you?"
</p>

<p>
"Have you heard anyone criticise me?" Constance
asked, hoping to extricate the conversation
from the depths of this argument by a ripple on
the surface.
</p>

<p>
"Some of them would.  You did yourself, you know."
</p>

<p>
"It was a new idea to me.  I have never thought
of marrying."  After a moment's silence, she
added, simply: "How would you like your son to
marry a divorced woman, Mrs. Perry?"
</p>

<p>
Her mind had picked out, instinctively, the crucial
question.  The old lady gave a little gasp and
start.
</p>

<p>
"A divorced woman?  Gordon?"  Then she
laughed.  "The way you said 'divorced woman'
had a formidable sound."  The personal application
was evidently a surprise to her; evidently, too,
it interested her, and she wrestled with it sitting
erect and bright-eyed.  In another moment she
had worked out the answer to her own satisfaction.
"It would depend upon her&mdash;what she was
like.  If she were innocent&mdash;if she had been grossly
wronged, and had sought the relief from her
distress which the laws allow, and I liked her and
he loved her, I shouldn't object.  Or, put it in this
way: I should prefer that Gordon did not marry
a widow, but a girl with all the freshness of her life
before her."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, indeed," murmured Constance.
</p>

<p>
"But plenty of young men fall in love with
widows and marry, and no one thinks any the
worse of the widows, or of them.  I'd fully as lief
Gordon married a divorced woman as one who
had buried her husband.  And if I were sure she
was a fine woman, I can imagine my sentiment
vanishing like moonshine, and my not minding a bit."
</p>

<p>
Constance shook her head thoughtfully.  "He
must marry some fine, sweet girl without a past,"
she said with gentle positiveness.
</p>

<p>
"Amen to that, my dear.  And the sooner the
better."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
One day early in September, in the summer
following the date of this conversation, Paul Howard
entered the office.  As he passed into Gordon's
private room, omitting the gay greeting which he was
wont to exchange with her, Constance noticed that
his expression was grave and tense, and that he
looked tired.  She said to herself that his summer
at Newport could not have rested him.
</p>

<p>
It was Paul's second season at Newport.  In
accordance with his half-humorous prediction, he
had hired there, the previous summer, one of the
most desirable villas, a spacious establishment
with a superb outlook to sea.  He had maintained
a large steam yacht, and an elaborate stable, and
had entertained lavishly.  All to please his wife.
At least so he regarded it, and this was in a large
measure the truth.  Ever since his marriage, five
years back, Paul had been thinking that he would
like to spend his vacation in some cool, picturesque
spot, far from scenes of social display, where with
his wife he could enjoy the beauties of nature
unreservedly, and recuperate from the fatigues of
the winter.  But, though he had hankered after
this in theory, and had broached the project to
Mrs. Howard, somehow it had never come to pass,
and he had been secretly aware for some time that
it never would, unless one of them had nervous
prostration and were ordered away by a physician.
For when one is a millionaire and has an ambitious
wife, one gets into the way of doing what other
millionaires do, and becomes acclimated to the
amusements proper to millionaires, until presently
the necessity of having luxuries at one's fingers'
ends makes any other programme seem insipid
and a bore.  Those who neglect to follow their
own tastes cannot fail to be moulded by the tastes
which they adopt.  We readily habituate ourselves
to our surroundings, whether it be too few baths,
or too many.  Paul delighted in the plumbing
facilities of his establishment.  He was perpetually
taking baths and changing his underclothes, and
the apprehension lest this orgie be interfered with
had taken the edge off his desire for closer
contact with the beauties of nature.  He recognized
the change in himself, but charged it to the account
of the spirit of the age, that convenient depository
of modern philosophers.  So, by the end of that
first summer, he had found himself content rather
than otherwise with the experience and disposed
to return.  To begin with, his wife was enthusiastic.
As she expressed it, she had had the time
of her life, which was comforting.  Although
from Monday morning to Thursday night had
been spent by him in New York (he had arranged
to be absent from Benham during the summer
months and take temporary charge of the New
York office), the rest of the week was passed at
Newport, and for the trip he had his own
comfortable yacht.  Besides, he took a fortnight in
August, during the time of the New York Yacht
Club cruise, with its opportunities to meet
familiarly men of importance in the financial world.
There was golf and riding and driving, his baths
and cocktails.  If he found the widely advertised,
and rather foolish, extravagant entertainments in
dog-day August, to which his wife dragged him,
tedious, he could generally slip away early if she
wished to stay to dance, and often he could
manage to be in New York when they occurred.
Besides, since to be present at them seemed to be
regarded as social recognition, he was gratified to
be treated as a millionaire would wish to be treated
in the society of millionaires.  To go, or at least
to be represented by his wife, who made his
excuses most charmingly he was told, showed that
he had not been left out, which is the controlling
reason why people go to festivities at Newport,
except to those where trinkets of real value are
given away in the course of the evening.  Paul
had fully intended to renounce cocktails.  In fact,
he had sworn off at Benham; but since they
appeared to take the place of a grace before meat
at every gathering of Newport's fashionable male
contingent, he had yielded again like a good
fellow to the spirit of the age just for one summer.
One swallow does not make a summer, as we all
know, and similarly, destiny often requires more
than one summer to carry the spirit of the age to
its logical conclusions.  This is true of the effect
of cocktails on the coats of the stomach, according
to the best medical authorities.  But we are
not considering that here.  Indeed, the working
out process which Paul now found confronting
him was outside of himself and concerned him
chiefly as a victim.  If his first summer at Newport
had been propitious, taking all things, including
the spirit of the age, into consideration, the second
had been productive of momentous issues.  It was
in relation to these that Paul had come to consult
Gordon Perry, his friend and legal adviser.

<h3>
XV
</h3>

<p>
Gordon Perry looked up from his desk
with an air of surprise.  "Why, Paul, I
thought you'd shaken the dust of Benham from
your feet until the last of the month."  Then
noticing his client's face as they joined hands, he
added, "I hope nothing has gone wrong."
</p>

<p>
"Everything is wrong."  Paul seated himself
with grave deliberation.  "Are you at leisure?
What I have to consult you about will take some
time."
</p>

<p>
"No one shall disturb us."
</p>

<p>
"It isn't business."  Then, after a moment's
silence, "It's my wife.  She has betrayed me."
</p>

<p>
"Your wife betrayed you?"  Gordon, as in his
bewilderment he echoed the words, recalled a
woman with a dainty figure, a small, sphinx-like
mouth, full cheeks devoid of color, and black hair.
He had never been at Paul's house, but he had
been introduced to her, and he had frequently seen
her and her little girl driving in her victoria, a
picture of up-to-date fastidiousness.  At the time
of her marriage she had been called the prettiest
girl in Benham.  She was the daughter of a
St. Louis contractor with a reputation for executive
ability, who had moved to Benham in her childhood
to become the president of a car-building
company.  Paul's friends had intimated that he
had gone rather out of his way to marry her.
Certainly it had been considered a brilliant match
for her.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  It's a pretty kettle of fish, as you'll
appreciate when you hear the story; a hopeless case
so far as our living together is concerned.  I've
come to you for advice and to talk it over, though
she and I threshed out the situation four days ago.
</p>

<p>
"May I smoke?  Thanks.  You don't here, I
know; but I go from cigar to cigar to keep my
nerves straight, for I'm still dazed, and I haven't
slept much."
</p>

<p>
"It's ghastly," murmured Gordon.
</p>

<p>
"Now that I look back I suppose I ought to
have realized that she never really cared for me.
Perhaps the gradual, unconscious perception of
that reacted on me.  I fell dead in love with her
looks, and would have worshipped the ground she
trod on had she proved what I thought her to be.
As it is, I'm humiliated, angry, disgusted, all at
sea.  But I can see that we should never be happy
together again.  Love in the true sense is over on
both sides.  I tell you this, Gordon, to begin with.
You haven't heard anything?"
</p>

<p>
"Not a word."
</p>

<p>
"I thought it likely they had copied the item
from the Newport into the Benham newspapers.
Five nights ago I popped at a man in my house
with a revolver&mdash;a long shot&mdash;just as he was
escaping over the balcony outside my wife's
apartment, and missed.  At the moment I would have
given half my fortune to kill him.  I dare say, it's
just as well I didn't.  There would have been a
bigger scandal.  It was one o'clock, and someone
who heard the noise&mdash;servants, I know not
who&mdash;talked, and two days later there appeared in one
of the newspapers an allusion to the mysterious
midnight pistol shot on the Howard place.  A
reporter called on me; I declined to see him, but my
butler, who can be trusted, had instructions to say
I was shooting cats.  That's all the public knows
as yet.  Here's a nice problem for the women's
debating clubs: A man discovers his wife's lover
in his place; ought he to shoot him like a rat on the
spot, or accept the situation for what it is worth,
just as he has to accept a death in the family, a
fire, or any other visitation of Providence?
Eh?"  Paul gave a short laugh.  "Of course the primitive
man shot every time.  But we can remember one
husband who did shoot and who killed, and that
all the exquisite people and some of the wise
people shook their heads and declared he ought to
have thought of his daughters.  There was a
world-wide scandal, and after the funeral we were
told that the husband had always been a crank,
in proof of which he died later in an insane asylum,
while his wife has hovered on the outskirts of the
smart set ever since as a sort of blessed martyr
to the rigor of conventions.  No, my dear fellow,
the only decent thing for me to do now is to
compromise myself deliberately with some common
woman, so as to give my wife the chance to obtain
a divorce from me.  That is the duty of the
gallant modern husband, according to the nicest and
latest fashionable code."
</p>

<p>
"You will do nothing of the kind, Paul."
</p>

<p>
"Wait until you have mulled over it as I have,
For the sake of my little girl her mother's
reputation must be sacred."
</p>

<p>
"I see.  Then her misconduct is not known?"
</p>

<p>
"It's a profound secret.  That is, no one has
seen her in the act, but it seems that all Newport
except myself has taken it for granted and been
whispering about it all summer.  It began last
summer, dolt that I was.  But it's not known
officially.  That is, the newspapers have not got
on to it."  Paul made a movement of impatience
and, rising, took a turn or two across the office.
He stopped in front of Gordon and said: "Mind
you, the temptation to kill him like a rat was not
presented to me.  I don't say I would have done
it.  I don't know what I would have done under
all the circumstances&mdash;the gruesome circumstances&mdash;had
we been face to face and he unarmed.  He
heard me and fled by the window.  I was in the
ante-room and stepped out on the balcony, and
running round merely saw a disappearing figure.  I
did not know who he was, but I surmised; and on
the spur of the moment I felt it was almost a
hopeless shot.  Who do you suppose he was?"
</p>

<p>
"I have no idea, of course."
</p>

<p>
"Guess."
</p>

<p>
"It would be useless.  I know no one at
Newport except yourself, Paul."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, you do.  Here's situation number two
in the tragedy.  It was my cousin Lucille's
husband, Clarence Waldo."
</p>

<p>
"For Heaven's sake!" Gordon ejaculated.  "It
can't be possible."
</p>

<p>
Paul's laugh broke forth again.  "Stunning,
isn't it?  No dramatist can improve on that.  But
I can.  I know what you're thinking," he said,
folding his arms, as he stood before Gordon with
a saturnine glee, as though he were enjoying the
other's consternation.  "You're wondering what
Mrs. Wilson will say?"
</p>

<p>
Gordon shook his head.  "It is terrible for her,
of course.  But I was thinking of your poor
cousin."
</p>

<p>
"Spare your pity in that quarter, man, until
you know the truth.  Situation number three!
Lucille and her husband have fallen out, agreed to
differ, ceased to love each other, never have loved
each other, and are to be divorced as soon as
circumstances will permit.  Waldo is to marry my
wife, and she&mdash;Lucille&mdash;has plighted her troth to
Bradbury Nicholson, of New York, a son of the
president of the Chemical Trust, of whom she is
enamoured, and with whom, it seems, she has been
carrying on clandestinely for months.  Didn't I
tell you I could improve on myself?  The curtain
now to red fire and the strains of Tschaikowsky!"
</p>

<p>
Paul flung himself into his chair, and squared
his jaw.  For a moment he looked like his father.
</p>

<p>
Gordon gazed at him with a brow of dismay.
"How do you know this?"
</p>

<p>
"From my wife.  She made a clean breast of
their affairs, and seemed to be rather surprised
that I didn't know.  It's all cut and dried.  That
is, it is to work out that way in the end, and soon,
if I'm accommodating.  And I am expected to be.
After the first flare-up, which was all on my part,
and did not take place until next morning, we
talked in our ordinary voices, as we are talking
now."  Since the climax of his narration, Paul's
sensational tone had ceased.  He seemed simply
tired, as though he had been suddenly let down.
"She set me the example.  You know her face.
She looked whiter than ever, but was perfectly
clear and explicit.  She said it was evident we were
not suited to each other.  Although I agreed with
her, I was fool enough to ask her why, and she
intimated politely, but clearly, that I bored
her&mdash;said we did not care for the same things.  She
admitted that I was not to blame for that, and that
I had been very generous in money matters.  Then
we talked and we talked and we talked, at that
time and again in the evening, until the small
hours.  The upshot is, we're to be divorced as soon
as it can be arranged.  She is to desert me, or I
her.  She seemed to be posted as to the law.  Or,
whatever way you suggest.  I've given in.  She
appealed to my common sense, as she called it.
She told me that we had made a mistake, that we
both knew it, and that the sooner we recognized
it, the better.  That there need be no disagreeable
publicity beyond the fact that we were no longer
to be husband and wife.  I couldn't deny that my
love for her was dead.  The only difficult question
was the child.  Neither of us wished to give
her up, and each of us would like to have her all
the time.
</p>

<p>
"Poor little thing!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, indeed.  When I thought of Helen, I
told my wife at first that I was ready to preserve
the outward forms of living together, in the teeth
of her unfaithfulness, for the sake of our child.
But she told me that I was old-fashioned.  She
asked whether I thought it would be worse for
Helen, or whether Helen would be less happy to
live as we should mutually arrange than to grow
up in a wretched household, where the father and
mother were utterly at variance.  That was a
poser.  It's the devil either way.  What do you
think?"
</p>

<p>
"It's the devil, as you say.  Amen, to that!
But if it's got to be&mdash;got to be," Gordon reiterated,
"I'm inclined to think your wife was right
in terming your protest old-fashioned.  Where a
marriage is utterly blasted, to retain the husk
merely for the sake of the children must fail, it
seems to me, in nine cases out of ten, to accomplish
its purpose&mdash;to preserve what society is
pleased to call the sanctity of the home."
</p>

<p>
"There would not be much sanctity left in
mine," Paul murmured.  "However, when she
saw that I was determined to have my full share
of Helen, or fight, we came to terms.  Helen is
to spend her winters with me, her summer
vacations with her mother; or some such arrangement;
and, of course, I am to provide for the child."  Paul
paused reflectively.  "I don't think it ever
occurred to my wife that we do not stand on an
equal footing, and that she would not be the best
of moral influences for a daughter.  It seems to
be an answer to everything that we were not
sympathetic, and that she has met somebody who is;
her affinity, as they say.  I had observed her
intimacy with Waldo, and was aware of some cases
at Newport where women had compromised
themselves with other women's husbands; and, though
I didn't exactly fancy Waldo's attentions, and had
hinted to her twice my disapproval&mdash;to which the
first time she pleaded surprise, and the second,
shrugged her shoulders&mdash;I never divined the truth
until I received this."  He drew a letter from his
pocket and handed it to Gordon.  "Even then, I
couldn't believe the worst."
</p>

<p>
Gordon perused the contents of the envelope, a
single sheet of paper on which were the words:
"When the cat's away, the mice will play."
</p>

<p>
"Humph!  Anonymous!" he said.
</p>

<p>
"She asked me what brought matters to a crisis,
and I told her.  She thinks it must have been sent
by a maid whom she discharged.  I received it at
my New York office in the middle of the week,
and the following Sunday night, instead of
leaving Newport in my yacht, as usual, I pretended to
do so, and returned late to my house on foot.
The rest you know.  It may be I was too much
absorbed in my business.  However, it's all over
now, and it's best it should be over.  What I wish
is advice as to the necessary steps; that you should
tell me what I ought to do."
</p>

<p>
"As to a divorce?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  She is to follow my instructions in regard
to it."
</p>

<p>
"And what as to the others&mdash;the Waldos?"
</p>

<p>
"No wonder you ask.  I put the same question
to her, and she told me that I needn't concern
myself about them; that they would find a way."
</p>

<p>
"There are certainly various ways if people
choose to connive at divorce.  There are certain
States where the residence essential to give the
court jurisdiction can be obtained in a pitifully
short time&mdash;even as short as three months, and
where an agreement to live apart is allowed,
through lack of scrutiny, to pass for genuine
desertion.  If Mrs. Waldo and her husband have
both been guilty of infidelity, neither is entitled
to a decree of divorce in any court of justice.  But
that concerns them, not you.  I was merely voicing
the regret which every decent man feels that there
shouldn't be a uniform law in all our States.  But
here one runs up against the vested rights of
sovereign peoples.  It's a far cry from South
Carolina, where no divorce is granted for any cause
whatever, to Wisconsin or Colorado, where
desertion for one year is sufficient.  Yet, if one had
to choose between the two, there is less injustice
and more regard for the welfare of society in the
latter extreme, radical as it is, than in the former.
Whatever happens, the world will never go back
to marital chains and slavery."  Turning to the
book-case at his elbow, Gordon selected a law book
and opened it.  "I don't hanker after divorce cases,
but I'm very glad you have come to me, Paul.  I
was simply shocked, at first; let me tell you now
how heartily sorry I am for you."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Don.  I knew you would be.  As
to my cousin, Lucille, I cannot say, positively, that
she has taken the final step&mdash;actually sinned.  My
wife admitted that she had no real knowledge,
though she took the worst for granted.  But it is
certain that the marriage is at an end, that she and
her husband are hopelessly alienated, and that at
the first opportunity she will marry this young
Nicholson.  As to myself, you agree with me, don't
you, that a divorce is the only possible, the only
sensible, course to adopt?"
</p>

<p>
Gordon paused a moment before replying.
"The only possible, no; the only sensible&mdash;since
you ask me as a friend as well as a client&mdash;in my
opinion, yes.  It's a point which every man must
decide for himself, if it confronts him.  Some
people would say to you that you should stick to your
wife, not live with her necessarily, but refuse to
break the bond; that she might repent and return
to you.  It seems to me, though, that if my wife
had been false to me and my love for her were
dead, I would not allow such a sentiment&mdash;and it
is only sentiment&mdash;to tie me forever to a woman
who was no longer my wife, except in name.  Your
life is before you.  Why should a vitiated
contract be a bar between you and happiness?  You
may wish to marry again."
</p>

<p>
Paul shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"Naturally you don't think so, now.  But why not?"
</p>

<p>
"As George the Second said, '<i>j'aurai des
maitresses</i>,'" Paul answered, a little bitterly.
</p>

<p>
"Exactly!" exclaimed Gordon, with eagerness.
"The continuance of such a bond would be a
premium on immorality.  That's a point which
sentimentalists do not take sufficiently into account.
Why is it necessary to marry again, they ask.  For
one thing, because a man's a man, as you and I
know.  It's a new question to me, Paul, because,
though it's one of the questions ever on the
surface, I have never had to deal with it squarely
until now.  The more I think of it the more sure
I am that a divorce would be sensible, and more
than that, sensible in the highest sense, without a
jot or a tittle of deprecation.  I know; you don't
wish to have to apologize.  All I can say is, if I
were in your shoes, I would do the same.  You
have a right to your freedom."
</p>

<p>
"I couldn't see it in any other light.  Besides,
my wife is bent on being free, herself.  If I do
not apply for a divorce, she will&mdash;and in the
shortest way."
</p>

<p>
"As to the method," continued Gordon, after a
moment's scrutiny of the volume before him, "it
is simple enough&mdash;a mere question of time.  In
this State where a party is guilty of a cause for
divorce&mdash;as in this case, infidelity&mdash;the injured
party is justified in leaving the home, and after
such separation has continued for the statutory
period, the injured party may obtain a divorce for
desertion.  Or, simpler still, your wife can desert
you, and after the necessary time has elapsed, the
same result would follow.  The statutory period
is three years."
</p>

<p>
"My wife will not like that."
</p>

<p>
"It is the only course, if she desires to preserve
her reputation.  If she prefers to have you bring
a libel for divorce on the ground of infidelity, she
can be free in a much shorter time.  Also she could
obtain her liberty somewhat sooner by changing
her residence to a more accommodating jurisdiction
and asking a divorce from you.  Provided
you offered no opposition, she might succeed, but
that would be a back-handed method discreditable
to you both, and an evasion of the laws of this
State, which might, hereafter, be productive of
unpleasant complications.  It's a sad business, but
you should have a clean job."
</p>

<p>
"Assuredly.  We could separate at once?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  But one of you must actually desert the
other.  An agreement to live apart does not
constitute legal desertion.  On the other hand, if she
were to leave your house, the court would not
inquire what was going on in your mind, provided
you did not show by any overt sign that you wished
to get rid of her.  You can be glad, but you must
not say so."
</p>

<p>
"I understand.  She need not be burdened with
my presence from the outset.  As for marrying
Waldo, she must wait her three years."
</p>

<p>
"And she may be thankful that she will be able
to marry as soon as the divorce is absolute.  In
some States the person against whom a divorce is
granted, is forbidden to marry altogether, or for
a period of years as a punishment.  To forbid
marriage altogether, in such cases, appears to me
another premium on immorality.  To forbid it
for a time, may sometimes prevent indecent haste
on the part of the guilty, but it is a good deal like
keeping after school children who have been
naughty.  Besides, the party forbidden to marry,
as in New York, for instance, has merely to step
into New Jersey and be married, and the second
marriage will be held legal by the New York
courts and everywhere else."
</p>

<p>
Paul was silent for a few moments.  "That
seems to me a decent programme.  My wife can
go to Europe, and&mdash;and when the time is up,
marry Waldo.  It's easy as rolling off a log."  He
clapped his strong hand on the wooden arm of his
chair, so that it resounded.  "My father will be
terribly cut up.  My aunt&mdash;God knows what she
will say or do.  As for myself"&mdash;he paused while
he lit a fresh cigar&mdash;"I shall have to go into
politics."
</p>

<p>
"Politics?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I'd like to go to Congress."  Paul sat
back in his chair with the air of one taking a
fresh brace on life.  "I've always intended to,
sooner or later.  Had it at the back of my mind.
But now&mdash;well, if I were sent to Washington, and
presently got a foreign mission, my wife might
feel sorry for a few minutes that I bored her.  Yet
I wouldn't have her back.  Waldo is welcome to
her.  The real reason," he added, suddenly, after
another pause, "is that I've been asked.  One of
the Republican State Committee spoke to me about
it in June, just before I went to Newport.  The
election isn't until a year from this autumn.  I
told him I'd think it over.  I've got to do something
to counteract this disgrace, and to forget it.
Well, I must be going.  I'll see you again as soon
as I hear from my wife."
</p>

<p>
Gordon detained him.  "You mustn't take too
despondent a view of it.  After all, it's not your
fault, it's your misfortune.  All your friends will
recognize that; and no one will be able to
understand how any woman could weary of the love of
a man like you, and prefer a listless, pleasure-seeker,
such as Clarence Waldo."
</p>

<p>
Paul shrugged his shoulders.  "It's the spirit
of the age, I suppose.  I'm not sorry, I tell you,
but I'm piqued.  We are shells upon the beach.
The tide sweeps us along even though we know it
is the tide, and can say of the next man, 'what
a fool he is, to drift like that!'  But what is a
fellow to do?  How is he to escape?  I'm a
millionaire&mdash;I'm likely to be several times that if
nothing breaks.  I didn't wish to go to Newport,
but I went.  I don't care for half the things I
do, but they have to be done; that is, I do them
of my own accord, when the time comes, and,
though I kick, I know I should regret not doing
them merely because they seem to be the proper
things for people of my kind.  There you are.  I
have a sort of double self, as you know.  It isn't
that I'm weak, it's&mdash;what do you call it?&mdash;the
force of my environment.  And a millionaire's
environment has a pressure of two hundred pounds
to the square inch.  It's the same with the women.
What with rich food, splendid apparel, perpetual
self-indulgence, and the power which money gives
them to gratify every whim, is it any wonder that
they don't let a little thing like the marriage vow
stand in the way of their individual preferences?
Who is to hold them to account?  The church?
Some of them go to church, but in their hearts
they are satisfied that this is the only world.  And
as to loss of social position&mdash;of which they really
would be afraid&mdash;the tide is with them.  There
are too many sympathizers.  Or at least, it is
inconvenient to be obliged to hurt other people's
feelings in a free country."
</p>

<p>
"Rather a formidable indictment against Newport,"
said Gordon.
</p>

<p>
"It isn't against Newport.  It's against the
plutocracy all over the country.  Newport merely
happens to be the place where very rich men with
social instincts most do congregate in summer.
My domestic tragedy is typical, yet sporadic.
Every season has its crop, but, numerically, it is
small.  Infidelity is only one of the phases of the
spirit&mdash;but the spirit is rampant.  Money-money-money,
luxury-luxury-luxury, self-self-self (individualism,
they call it), and in the process everything
is thrown overboard, except the American
flag, and life becomes one grand hurrah, boys, with
no limitations, save murder and lack of physical
cleanliness.  And I belong to the procession, my
dear fellow.  I'm disgusted with it at the moment,
that's why I rail.  But in six months I shall be in
it again.  See if I'm not."
</p>

<p>
"You're simply depressed, Paul, and no wonder,"
said Gordon, with genial solicitude.  "But
we mustn't judge our plutocracy&mdash;aristocracy, or
whatever you choose to call the personal
representatives of the prosperity of the country&mdash;by
the antics of a few, disgusting as they are.  I
agree that their behavior apes the frivolity and
license of the old French court without its
elegance, and I don't suppose that the founders of
our institutions ever included a leisure class as a
part of their scheme.  Absorbed in ideals, they
neglected to take poor human nature sufficiently
into account.  We have lost the buffalo, but we
have acquired a leisure class, and we must make
the best of it, not the worst.  We can't cut their
heads off; this is a free country.  It would be
dreadful&mdash;dreadful, wouldn't it, if our
institutions, of which we are so proud, were to produce
merely the same old thing over again&mdash;a leisure
class of voluptuaries?"  Gordon paused for a
moment and his smile died away at the vision which
his words evoked.  "I don't intend to believe it;
you don't.  There are students of destiny who
maintain that nations rise, reach maturity and
decline by regular economic laws, but that human
nature never really improves.  That's fatalism.
The free play of human individualism is having
its last grand chance here in these United States.
If our aristocracy proves no better than any other&mdash;if
the rich and powerful are to sneer at morals
and wallow in licentiousness, we couldn't blame
society if it should try a strong dose of socialism,
with its repressing, monotonous dead level, rather
than accept the doctrine that the law of supply
and demand is the sole ruler of the universe.  But
as good Americans we can't afford to judge our
plutocracy, as yet, by the vices of a few people at
Newport."
</p>

<p>
"They sin in such a cold-blooded way," said
Paul.  "If they really cared, as some of the
foreigners do, one could understand; but they don't."
</p>

<p>
"I know.  It's one of the canons of old-world
traditions that adultery is almost redeemed by the
possession of an artistic sense.  To commit the
one without possessing the other, may be no worse
morally, yet it seems much more vulgar.  But we
mustn't take them too seriously, even though they
are our countrymen and women.  They are the
exceptions&mdash;the excrescences.  Look at your father,
for instance.  He belongs to them&mdash;but he is not
of them.  The same is true of yourself; and it is
a privilege, with all its responsibilities, a privilege
I envy you.  Who wouldn't be a multi-millionaire
if he could?  What is more alluring than power?"
</p>

<p>
Paul returned the pressure of his friend's hand.
"You're a good fellow, Don.  I suppose I'm
hipped.  That's not my way, as you know.
Usually everything with me is rose color; I'm too
good an American, if anything."  He buttoned his
well-fitting coat with a dignified air, as though the
pride of the suggestion had stirred his pulses like
a brass band.  "The trouble is, that when I'm
feeling well, everything goes, and the only thing
which seems of importance is to come out ahead of
the other fellow.  So we kick over standards and
degenerate.  This time I've been struck with a
club, and&mdash;and I don't see that it's my fault.
Well, good-bye.  As soon as I hear, I'll let you
know."

XVI
</h3>

<p>
There was only one shadow on Constance's
present happiness, for she was happy in her
independence and her work.  She had demonstrated
her ability to support herself and to defy
the blow of fate which had deprived her of a
husband's aid and protection.  It was the growing
perception that she might not be able to do all
she desired for her children.  This sprang from
her own keener appreciation of the value not only
of the best educational advantages, but of refined
personal surroundings in the development of
character.  She could inculcate noble morals; she
could teach her children to be truthful, brave, and
simple; she could provide them with public school
instruction, and she was resolved to give them, if
her health remained good, the opportunity to
continue their education longer than was the wont
with parents whose offspring had their own way
to make in life unaided.  But her ambition, or
rather her perception of what she desired for
them, did not stop here.  There were present
demands which must be neglected solely because
of her straitened circumstances; and she beheld
ahead a long and widening vista of privileges
from which, perforce, they would be debarred
during the formative years for a similar reason.
Henrietta's teeth were disconcertingly crooked,
and should have the continuous attention of a
skilful dentist, and her voice had already that nasal
twang which, if unchecked, is sure to result in
feminine inelegance of speech.  She wished that
both the children, especially the girl, might have
thorough instruction in French and music, and be
sent to dancing school.  Little Emil was giving
signs of marked talent for drawing, and the
thought of how that gift could be developed, was
already causing her concern.  It was obvious to
her that each of the next ten years had more
insistent instances in store for her.  She knew that
she could give her children what the democratic
world delights to call a solid foundation, but she
was eager to equip them with stimulating mental
ideals and bodily graces, to put them within reach
of excellence and culture.
</p>

<p>
She was too grateful to repine or to allow this
shadow to oppress her spirit.  Its sole effect was
to stimulate her energies, to make her fertile in
resources to counteract this disability, and
painstaking in attention to her duties in the hope of a
small increase in salary.  She kept a close watch
on Henrietta's voice, and put her on her own
guard against its piercing quality; she organized a
small dancing class from among the children in
Lincoln Chambers for one evening in the week,
and from her own past experience essayed their
instruction in waltzing and social decorum.  Also,
on Sunday afternoons, she would often lure Emil
and Henrietta to the new Art Museum and give
them the opportunity which her own youth had
lacked to discern artistic form and color, and to
acquire inspiration from world-famous or
exemplary paintings and sculpture.  Then there
suddenly came to her as treasure-trove a new fund to
be drawn on for such purposes.  Her employer,
scanning the field of philanthropy by the light of
his own professional experience, had realized that
there was need in Benham of a legal aid society&mdash;that
is, of an organization which would defray
the charges of a firm of attorneys to whom people
in utter distress, without means, and with petty but
desperate grievances in which busy lawyers could
not afford to interest themselves, could apply for
succor.  When it appeared that the clerical duties
incident to the fund collected for this charity must
be performed by some suitable person, it occurred
to Gordon Perry&mdash;he had been seeking some such
occasion&mdash;that Mrs. Stuart would make an
admirable secretary and treasurer, especially as he
intended that the society should pay two hundred
dollars for the annual service.  Constance's heart
throbbed with delight at the announcement, and
the first fifty dollars was devoted by her to the
treatment of Henrietta's irregular front teeth.
Would she be able some day to send Emil to
college?  Might she hope that her daughter would
grow to be thoroughly a lady, not merely a smart,
self-sufficient woman, but a gracious, refined,
exquisite spirit like Mrs. Randolph Wilson?  In her
outlook for her children's future, she had become
aware that she had set up two individuals for
emulation: the woman whose æsthetic Christianity
had enriched her life, and the man whose
unaffected intelligence and vigor offered to her daily
observation an example of honorable modern living.
To lift her own flesh and blood above the
rut of mediocre aims and attainments was now
the ambition of her soul, and she was ready to
strain every nerve to bring this to pass.

<br />
Constance would find her in possession at Lincoln Chambers
</p>

<p>
Her acquaintance with Mrs. Perry had ripened
into intimacy.  The old lady had taken a strong
fancy to her, and the liking was cordially reciprocated.
This meant increasing friendliness on both
sides.  Not infrequently, on her return from the
office, Constance would find her in possession at
Lincoln Chambers with the room warm, five
o'clock tea ready, Henrietta in her lap and Emil
beside her, listening to absorbing reading or
stories, each of which had a pungent, personal
flavor, with a not too obtrusive moral.  On the
other hand, Constance was asked to dine every
now and then in the new house, and after dinner,
sometimes it happened that they went to the
theatre with Mr. Perry, or on evenings when he was
busy, the two women would sit cosily with their
work, and conversation never flagged.  Women,
when sympathetically attached to each other,
seem to be inexhaustible reservoirs of speech,
which flow with a bubbling copiousness bewildering
to masculine ears.  In their case, the hands of
the clock set the only limit to their mutual
enjoyment.  The hour of departure brought the single
uncomfortable moments of the evening for
Constance&mdash;that is, for the first two evenings.  Her
apartment was a full mile distant, but her friends'
house was not more than two hundred yards from
a line of electric cars which passed within a block
from her own door.  Until Gordon Perry, who
came out of his library to say good-night,
announced his intention of accompanying her home,
the idea had never occurred to her that it was
necessary, or that he would offer his escort.  Yet
such are the inconsistencies of the feminine mind
that the moment he did so she became aware that,
if he had not offered it, she would have felt a
trifle hurt.  At the same time she did not wish
him to accompany her.  It would be obviously a
superfluous piece of politeness; there was no risk
of any kind in going home in the cars alone.  She
told him this in a few words of clear remonstrance.
But he smilingly put on his overcoat,
said it was a beautiful moonlight night, and
assured her that he was anxious for a walk before
going to bed.  The idea of his walking only made
the situation worse.  Constance turned to his
mother for support, but Mrs. Perry cordially
seconded his assertion that it would do him good,
so there was no escape from acceptance.  The
thought of having dragged a busy man&mdash;and her
employer&mdash;out of his house at night disturbed her
equinamity all the way home, so that although
she delighted in having him as a companion in
the exhilarating autumn air, under a glorious
moon, she determined to prevent its recurrence.
Yet, as she approached her destination, the fear
of seeming ungracious supervened, and she had
almost decided to postpone her protest until the
next time, when he unwittingly gave her an
opportunity to speak by remarking that he hoped
that this was only one of many evenings which
she would spend with them during the winter.
"You must know," he added, "that my mother
has taken a great fancy to you, and that it will not
suit her at all if you are niggardly in your visits."
</p>

<p>
Constance smiled acquiescingly.  "I love your
mother," she said, "and it will be a pleasure to
me to come as often as she wishes."  At the same
instant she said to herself, "Now for it!"  Whereupon
she began sturdily, "Only, Mr. Perry&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Why did she pause?  She was at a loss to know.
It was the reverse of her custom to begin a
sentence and leave it dangling in this unfinished
manner.  She accused herself of being a goose, and,
simultaneously she took a new breath to go on,
only to be met by her companion's blithe sally:
</p>

<p>
"Only what, Mrs. Stuart?"  She could see that
his eyes were laughing.  Did he divine what was
choking her?
</p>

<p>
"Only this: if I come to your mother, you must
let me go home by myself.  The electric cars are a
stone's throw from your house, and run close to
mine, so there is not the slightest necessity
for your incommoding yourself."  She paused,
troubled.  The last turn of the sentence, though
it expressed her meaning, had not the felicitous
sound she desired.
</p>

<p>
"I came because I knew it would give me pleasure,"
he answered, quickly, still with a laughing
light in his eyes, under which she let her own fall
quite unnecessarily, as it seemed to her.  She was
provoked with herself.  The dialogue had acquired
the aspect of social give and take, which
was entirely remote from her intention.
</p>

<p>
"I have enjoyed it, too."  She felt that this
was the least she could say.  "But there is no
need; besides, Mr. Perry, you are my employer,
and&mdash;and&mdash;" (she was halting again, but she bit
her lip and plunged forward, seeking only to make
herself clear) "that does make a difference&mdash;it
should make a difference.  If I were&mdash;if I were
not your stenographer, I should probably go home
in a carriage, but I can't afford one, and&mdash;and the
cars are perfectly safe and comfortable.  I am
used to looking after myself."
</p>

<p>
Her cheeks were burning.  She had said what
she meant to say, but it sounded crude and almost
harsh.  She wondered now why it had seemed
necessary to her to make such a pother.  As no
immediate answer came from Mr. Perry, she stole
a glance at his face.  It had grown almost grave,
and there was a different light in his eyes&mdash;a
curious expression which puzzled her.  "I hope you
understand," she said, "and that I do not seem
ungracious."
</p>

<p>
"I understand perfectly.  I was admiring your
sense&mdash;your sanity.  Such things do make a
difference&mdash;must make a difference, so long as human
nature is constituted as it is; but every woman has
not the hardihood to accept the limitations of her
social lot.  As you say, you are used to looking
after yourself.  I should not have been guilty of
a breach of manners, had I allowed you to go
home in a car as you came&mdash;put you into one,
perhaps, at the street corner, if I were not
occupied.  That would have been the natural course
under all the circumstances, although it might
have been equally natural to treat another woman
with more ceremony.  I came with you to-night
because it gave me pleasure, as I told you, and
because I wished you to understand that the
relations between us are not those of employer and
employee, but social in every sense.  You are my
mother's friend and mine."
</p>

<p>
Constance's nerves tingled pleasantly at the
apostrophe.  "You are very good.  You have
always been kindness itself to me.  I have felt that
you both were my friends."  She put out her hand
shyly and gratefully to bid him good-night, and
at the same time to indicate the warmth in her
heart.  "But now that I do understand," she
added, "you must be sensible, too, and realize that I
do not need an escort."  She was rather appalled
by her own boldness.  His plea had only strengthened
her feeling that his politeness was superfluous.
</p>

<p>
"Do you forbid it?" he asked, with an inflection
of gayety.
</p>

<p>
She could not help smiling.  "I cannot do that,
you know.  But if you wish to make me feel
entirely at home, you will limit yourself at most to
seeing me safely on a car at your street corner."  She
felt that she had touched firmer ground&mdash;that
she was making her claim as a friend of the family,
not being forced against her will into the pose
of a coquette.
</p>

<p>
"A compromise!" he ejaculated.  "And what a
one-sided one."
</p>

<p>
"Life is made up of compromises, is it not?
I thought I was being very generous."
</p>

<p>
There was a gentle, plaintive cadence to her
words which both charmed his ear and touched
his sensibilities.  Was she about to strike her flag
in the last ditch out of sheer weariness at his
bravado?
</p>

<p>
"My only wish would be to please you," he
said with sudden earnestness.
</p>

<p>
Constance looked at him wonderingly, a little
appalled at the change in his manner and speech.
What had called forth their intensity?  She
became conscious that the blood was rising to her
cheeks again, and that she had lost her composure
a second time.  For an instant Gordon gazed
at her eagerly, as though he enjoyed her bewilderment,
then with a return of gayety, he exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
"But I promise nothing&mdash;nothing."
</p>

<p>
He raised his hat and Constance, who had already
entered the vestibule of her apartment-house,
stood irresolute before ascending the stairs
as one in a trance.  She was displeased with
herself; for the first time in her life it had seemed to
her that her tongue and her wits were not under the
control of her will.  Presently she reflected that
she might be working too hard and was run down,
which on the whole, was comforting, until she
looked in her mirror and saw there the refutation
of this theory in her own hue of health.  No, it
could not be this, for there was no blinking the
fact that she had improved notably in her appearance
of late, which was comforting in a different
way.  She was so struck by the fact that she stood
for a moment surveying her face and figure with
contemplative surprise.  But why had Mr. Perry
been so queer?  She asked herself that question
more than once before she fell asleep, and in the
morning ascribed it to her own social inaptness.
</p>

<p>
The next occasion when she spent the evening
with Mrs. Perry was a fortnight later.  When
she was ready to go home Gordon put on his overcoat
without a word and confronted her tantalizingly.
She was conscious of a little disappointment,
for, in spite of his declaration of independence,
she had believed that he would not persist,
but as he opened the front door she heard the
welcome words:
</p>

<p>
"To-night I am going to comply with your wish
by putting you on a car at the next corner."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, very much."  She forebore to
add what was in her mind, that it was the only
sensible way.  But her little triumph gave
elasticity to her steps.
</p>

<p>
For the first few moments the night seemed to
set a seal upon his lips as he walked beside her,
so that his response had the effect of being
pondered.  "My desire is to please you.  But I shall
reserve the right of pleasing myself now and then
as I did the other day."
</p>

<p>
"It pleased me, too," Constance said, amiably.
"What I feared was that it might become a
custom&mdash;an unnecessary burden."
</p>

<p>
Gordon signalled an approaching car.  "A
burden?  Mrs. Stuart, the burden of walking home
by moonlight with the wrong woman is one which
men generally manage to shift."
</p>

<p>
Constance laughed.  "Perhaps I should have
thought of that.  But now you will be protected
at all events."
</p>

<p>
From her seat in the electric car she beheld him
standing at the street corner until his figure was lost
in the shadows of the night.  She felt complacent.
She had gained her point, and since it was on
terms need she feel otherwise than happy at the
prospect of having him sometimes as a companion
on her journeys home?  The more she could see
of him rightfully, without encroaching on his
time, surely the better for her.  The discretion
rested with him, not with her; she was simply the
fortunate beneficiary.
</p>

<p>
So it came to pass that once in three or four
times Gordon would exercise his privilege; and
as another year slipped away and the spring
brought milder nights and more inviting sidewalks,
the occasions became more frequent, so that before
either seemed to be aware of it, the custom
of riding was more honored in the breach
than the observance, and this without further
discussion.  They would simply start as though
she were to take an electric car, and before
reaching the corner he would casually interrupt their
discourse to say, "It is a fine night; shall we
walk?" to which Constance would reply, "If you
like."  After a while even this formula was
dispensed with, and she was ready to take for
granted that they both preferred the exercise.
One day he asked permission to accompany her
and her children on one of their Sunday afternoon
strolls into the country, a proposal which startled
her, but which she had no obvious excuse for
refusing.  On their return home from the excursion
Henrietta and little Emil were so enthusiastic over
this addition to the party that she felt reluctant
on their account to prevent its repetition.  So the
experience was renewed every now and then, and,
since he seemed to enjoy it, she accepted it as one
of the pleasures which Providence had thrown in
her way.
</p>

<p>
Intimacy naturally resulted from this increasing
association.  It was a constant comfort to
Constance that Mr. Perry was such a natural
person; that he obviously liked her for herself, but
did not affect to ignore or gloss over the fact that
her life was circumscribed and straitened by her
necessities; that, while assuming that she was
interested in and able to appreciate the finer
aspirations and concerns of existence, he let her perceive
that he understood her predicament.  Consequently
she felt at liberty and encouraged to speak to
him from time to time on the subject nearest her
heart&mdash;the advancement of her children&mdash;and to
ask advice in relation thereto.
</p>

<p>
On one of their evenings&mdash;a moonlight night,
which rivalled in beauty that when he had first
accompanied her&mdash;she had been consulting him as to
the conditions of a free art school recently started
in the new Art Museum, having little Emil in
mind.  After a short silence she suddenly said,
"I admire your mother greatly, as you know.
But sometimes I am doubtful whether she does
not discourage me even more than she gives me
hope; her example, I mean.  She brought you up.
She was almost as friendless as I.  I dare say she
did not have so many friends.  Yet&mdash;yet you are
you.  She managed to give you everything."
</p>

<p>
"God bless her, yes, brave heart that she is."
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He cut her pensive conjunctive short.  "I can
guess what you are going to say.  Excuse me; go on."
</p>

<p>
"I cannot give my children everything.  But
everything, then, would not be everything now."
</p>

<p>
"I divined your thought."  The sympathy
radiating from his sturdy tone brought a pleasant
light to her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Yet you are you," she reasserted.
</p>

<p>
He laughed.  "Logician and flatterer!  But
you are right.  My mother would have had a far
harder struggle had she begun to-day.  She might
not have been able to give me everything, for
everything then was not everything now, as you
have said."
</p>

<p>
"Yet you have everything," she persisted,
doughtily.
</p>

<p>
"Even if that were true, it would not signify.
You are facing a condition, not a theory.  Flour
and sugar and standard oil may be cheaper to-day,
but the demands of civilization on the individual
are so much greater&mdash;of civilization everywhere,
but especially in this country, where the growth of
prosperity has been so prodigious and the stress
of competition has become so fierce."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes; oh, yes.  You understand," she said,
eagerly.  "There are so many things which I
should like to give my children which I cannot&mdash;which
I know are beyond my reach, but which
would be of infinite service to them in the struggle
to make the most of life.  You spoke to me once
of the limitation of my social lot.  That is
nothing.  What is hard for a mother to bear is
the consciousness that her children will fall short
of what she would wish them to become because
she has not the power to secure for them the best.
Yet it must be borne, and borne bravely."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it is lamentably hard.  The chief blot on
the triumph of individualism&mdash;on the American
principle of the development of self&mdash;is that the
choicest privileges of civilization should hang
beyond the reach of those who are handicapped
merely because they are handicapped.  The
destruction of the poor is their poverty, as my old
school-master used to state, though I didn't know
then what he meant.  And it must be borne, as
you say.  Even here, where everything is possible
to the individual, renunciation still stares
the majority in the face as the inexorable
virtue."
</p>

<p>
"Surely," she answered, with simple pathos.
"Thank you for understanding me.  I knew you
would.  If I struggle, it is because I am so
ambitious for my children to rise.  I would not have
them remain mere hewers of wood and drawers
of water&mdash;one of the majority you speak of&mdash;as
I have been."
</p>

<p>
He turned his face toward her.  "You are far
more than that, you are a sweet woman.  You
must not underestimate character in your recognition
of the power of things.  You can give your
children that, and it is no cant to say that character
remains everlastingly the backbone of human
progress."
</p>

<p>
"Things!" she echoed, ignoring apparently
both the tribute and the consolation proffered.
"That is the word."  She hugged her thought in
silence for a moment as though fascinated.
"When I was a girl there were no things to speak
of; now&mdash;" she paused and sighed; evidently the
vision which her spirit entertained disconcerted her
powers of speech.  "It is not that I wish my
children to be rich&mdash;merely rich, Mr. Perry.  You
know that.  It is that I wish them to be able to
appreciate, to feel, to enjoy what is best in life.
You spoke of the power of character just now.
There is Mrs. Randolph Wilson.  She has all the
virtues of plain character and so much more
besides.  Compare her with a woman like me."
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Randolph Wilson!"  His tone revealed
his surprise at the antithesis.  "I see.  I see," he
repeated, interested by the completeness of the
contrast.
</p>

<p>
"I owe so much to her," Constance murmured.
"Before I knew her my outlook was so narrow
and colorless.  She has taught me to enrich my
life, poor as it still is."
</p>

<p>
"She is a fine woman.  And yet, in my opinion,
you need not fear comparison with Mrs. Wilson."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mr. Perry!"  She stopped short for an
instant in recoil.  The protesting astonishment of
her exclamation showed him not only that he had
violated a temple by his words, but that, as a
consequence, she believed him insincere, which in
her eyes would be a more grievous fault.
</p>

<p>
"It is quite true," he said with decision.  "You
are very different; but it is quite true.  Your
outlook was narrow, perhaps, but it was clear and
straight."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no.  You do not know her, then, nor me.
I tried to see clearly according to my lights, but
that is just it&mdash;my lights were defective, and I
saw only half the truth until she revealed it to
me."
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Wilson has had great opportunities."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, indeed.  And she has taken advantage of
them.  Great opportunities!" she repeated with
an exultant sigh.  "They are what I had in mind
a few minutes ago; not for myself, you know, but
for my children.  I envy&mdash;yes, I envy opportunities
for them."  Her voice had a quiver as though
she were daring a confession to the sphinx-like
stars.
</p>

<p>
She had changed the emphasis of the dialogue,
but Gordon pursued his tenor.  "Her daughter
has had every opportunity, yet her mother can
scarcely regard her with pride."
</p>

<p>
"I barely know Mrs. Waldo.  It was just before
her wedding that her mother was so kind to
to me.  I saw her once or twice at the house, but
only for a moment."
</p>

<p>
"At least she has made a mess of her marriage."
</p>

<p>
Constance started.  "It is true, then, what was
in the newspapers?"
</p>

<p>
"It is true that she and her husband have
agreed to separate.  It is an open secret that she
has gone to Sioux Falls in order to obtain a divorce
on a colorless ground in the shortest possible time.
They will both be free in less than a year."
</p>

<p>
"How terrible!  Loretta Davis read me a
paragraph last week to the effect that Mr. and
Mrs. Waldo were not happy.  I set it down as baseless
gossip.  It seemed to me impossible that
Mrs. Wilson's daughter&mdash;Ah, I am so sorry for
Mrs. Wilson."
</p>

<p>
"She was in the office last week."
</p>

<p>
"I remember."
</p>

<p>
"She came to consult me; to see if anything
could be done.  She has reasoned with her
daughter&mdash;used every argument in her arsenal&mdash;but
without avail.  Mrs. Waldo's one idea is to be
free.  And yet she has had every opportunity."
</p>

<p>
"But that proves nothing, Mr. Perry, surely."  They
had reached the threshold of Lincoln
Chambers.  There was the courage of conviction in the
frank gaze she bent on him.
</p>

<p>
"Only that the power to have everything may
numb the spirit and make individual self-will the
sole arbiter of conduct."
</p>

<p>
"Agreed.  But there can be no doubt that
civilization offers us more to-day than it ever did if
we can only be put within reach of it.  The
thought sometimes haunts me that I may die and
Henrietta grow up to be like&mdash;like Loretta Davis;
never know what life may mean, because she has
not had the chance."
</p>

<p>
He looked at her admiringly.  "I am more
than half teasing you," he said.  "While it is true
that the general standard of living is higher than
ever before, it remains true as ever that only the
attuned spirit can grasp and utilize the best.  To
argue otherwise would be cant."
</p>

<p>
"So it seems to me," she said, with her air of
direct simplicity.
</p>

<p>
"As for this tragedy&mdash;for it is a tragedy almost
Sophoclean in its scope, as you will presently
learn, my lips are sealed for the moment beyond
what I have told you.  But you are right in your
enthusiasm for Mrs. Wilson.  She is in touch with
the temper of the world's progress&mdash;according to
her lights."
</p>

<p>
She smiled faintly.  "I still wish I were more
like her."
</p>

<p>
Gordon seemed for a moment to be pondering
this assertion, then fixing her with his eyes, said:
"I believe you have never heard anything from
your husband since he deserted you?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing."
</p>

<p>
"You do not know his whereabouts, nor whether
he is alive or dead?"
</p>

<p>
She shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"More than three years have elapsed.  So you
are entitled to a divorce in this State, if you see fit
to claim it."
</p>

<p>
Constance had listened in astonishment.  His
tone was so respectful that she could not take
offence.  He seemed to be merely informing her as
to her rights; and though the topic had never been
broached up to this time between them, was he not
her intimate friend?  Nevertheless she felt agitated.
</p>

<p>
"It has never occurred to me that a divorce
would be desirable," she answered with as much
formality as her dislike of artifice allowed her to
adopt.  Then, yielding to curiosity or the inclination
to break another lance with him, she added:
"Of what benefit would it be to me to seek a
divorce?"
</p>

<p>
"Merely that the bond is already broken; what
remains is a husk."
</p>

<p>
"My husband may return."  The response
struck her as futile; still it had risen to her lips
as a convenient possibility.
</p>

<p>
"That is true.  But if he did return after what
has happened, I should think&mdash;I have no right
to invade your privacy&mdash;"  He stopped short, evidently
appalled by the sound of his own presumption.
</p>

<p>
There was a brief silence.  It would have been
easy for Constance to leave his inquiry where he
had left it, but her love for the truth caused her
first to face the issue thus presented, and having
solved it by one full glance, to bear testimony to
what was in her heart.  Why she felt this frankness
necessary, she did not know, unless it were
that he was such a friend she did not wish him to
think he had offended.  The interval was only
momentary, but she appeared to herself to have
been standing speechless in the presence of the
ashes of her past for an awkward period before
she said:
</p>

<p>
"My husband said when he went away that we
could never be happy together.  I do not wish him
to return."
</p>

<p>
She realized she was telling him her love was
dead.  It was the truth; why should he not know?
She heard him draw a deep breath.  Suddenly
remembering the argument which had provoked his
question, her mind flew to it for refuge and
sheltered itself behind it as a bulwark.
</p>

<p>
"But that is no reason why I should seek a
divorce.  A divorce could not alter the situation."
</p>

<p>
He hesitated a moment as though he were about
to continue the discussion, then evidently thought
better of it.  "I simply wished you to know your
rights.  Good-night."
</p>

<h3>
XVII
</h3>

<p>
As she reached the landing upon which her own
apartment opened, Constance noticed that
there was a light in Loretta Davis's room.
Loretta was now a full-fledged nurse.  That is, she had
completed her course at the hospital, and was
taking cases of her own.  She had already
obtained two or three through the patronage of
Mrs. Wilson, but she happened to be out of work at
the moment.  It occurred to Constance that she
would impart her information to her neighbor.
Loretta was deeply interested in everything which
concerned their benefactress.  Loretta had seen
what was in the newspapers, and, since it was true,
why should not she know?  This was a plausible
excuse for gratifying that strong desire to share
her knowledge which assails every woman who has
something to tell.  Had it been a real secret,
Constance would have been adamant.  As it was, she
did not appreciate until too late that this was just
the sort of subject which she and Loretta could
not discuss sympathetically.  She was sorry for
her; she did her best to befriend and encourage
her, and tried to like her; but though they got on
pleasantly, their point of view was apt to be
radically different.
</p>

<p>
Loretta opened the door.  "Oh, it's you,
Constance.  I'd made up my mind that someone had
sent for me."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry to disappoint you, Loretta.  But I've
something to tell you&mdash;something you'll be
distressed to hear.  What you read in the newspaper
about Mrs. Wilson's daughter&mdash;the Waldos&mdash;is
true."
</p>

<p>
Then she repeated briefly what she knew, omitting
reference to Mrs. Wilson's visit to the office.
Loretta listened with parted lips and an expression
in her usually matter-of-fact face curiously
compounded of solicitude and knowingness, as though
commiseration and the glamor of the scandal were
contending forces.
</p>

<p>
"I knew it was true; the newspapers wouldn't
have printed it unless there'd been something in it.
My! but she'll feel bad, won't she?"
</p>

<p>
"It will wound her terribly."
</p>

<p>
"How did your boss find out?"
</p>

<p>
Constance winced.  Somehow the epithet jarred
worse than usual, and she felt that she could not
stand it.  The experiences of the evening were on
her nerves, though sympathy for Mrs. Wilson had
thrust her personal emotions to the back of her
mind for more leisurely inspection.
</p>

<p>
"You mustn't call him that, Loretta.  It doesn't
express him at all."
</p>

<p>
Loretta looked surprised and laughed.
"What's the matter?  He is your boss, isn't
he?" she asserted.  "Oh, well&mdash;your employer,
Mr. Gordon Perry, Esq., counsellor-at-law, if
that'll suit you.  My! but you're getting red."
</p>

<p>
Constance was annoyed with herself for having
protested.  Indeed, she was biting her tongue for
having brought on the interview.  Now that she
had told the facts she shrank from further
discussion.  Yet it was patent that Loretta had every
intention of discussing the episode with her.
</p>

<p>
"There's no doubt about the truth of the matter,
unfortunately," she said, by way of answer
to the original question.
</p>

<p>
Loretta's large eyes began to rove.  Then they
suddenly fixed Constance with the gleam of a
transporting idea.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to see her, right off&mdash;to-morrow, I
mean," she added, noting the swift, barometric
sign of disapproval which her words evoked,
though it was no more than a contraction of the
eyelids.  But, suspicious as she was, she assumed
that the only criticism had been that she was going
forthwith.
</p>

<p>
From the moment Gordon Perry had spoken,
Constance had been yearning to hasten to
Mrs. Wilson's side and offer the sympathy which she
felt.  This had been her first impulse too, but a
moment's reflection had proved to her that to do
so was out of the question; that it would be an
intrusion&mdash;a violation of that subtle code of nicety
which governed her benefactress's life.  Mrs. Wilson
was the last woman to betray to the every-day
world that she was sorely wounded.  Was not
endurance of suffering without plaint and with an
unruffled countenance one of the tenets of her
friend's æsthetic creed?  So what right had a
person like herself to invade her privacy?  No, she
must remain dumb until Mrs. Wilson gave her the
opportunity to speak or publicity offered an excuse
for flowers or some token of affection.  Thus she
had reasoned, and hence her involuntary challenge
to Loretta's confident announcement.
</p>

<p>
"She'll expect me to be sorry for her, and I am,"
pursued Loretta, complacent over her project.
"I'll ask her all about it.  Won't it make a stir in
the newspapers!  There'll be a new picture of her,
sure."  Thus reminded, she opened a table drawer
and produced a large scrap-book, which she
exhibited to Constance with an air of satisfaction.
It was made up of newspaper illustrations and
clippings relative to the object of adoration&mdash;pictures
of Mrs. Wilson in a variety of poses, of her
house, of her equipages, and of everything which
the reportorial artist had been able to reproduce;
also scores of allusions to her in print culled from
the social columns.  It was a current, but a
thorough collection, for Loretta had purchased back
issues in order to possess the newspaper features
of the wedding ceremonies.  It was to these she
now turned, staying her hand at a page where the
bride and her mother looked forth, ranged side
by side in festal attire.  Loretta surveyed them
contemplatively.  "I never laid eyes on the
daughter.  They're not much alike, are they?
Perhaps she'll be at home when I go.  I'd give
anything to see her."
</p>

<p>
The scrap-book was not new to Constance, but
it had been considerably amplified since she had
seen it last.  She had never been able to
understand why Loretta had undertaken or prized it.
Nevertheless, it was a symptom of hero-worship
in line with collections of the photographs of
adored actors by matinee girls, and was not to be
despised too heartily if she wished to remain
sympathetic.  But just now Constance's mind was
otherwise busy.  She, too, adored Mrs. Wilson,
and she painfully depicted to herself the annoyance
which this visit with its threatened frankness
would cause her divinity.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you think, Loretta, that it would be
better to wait a little before you call?" she said,
in gentle appeal.
</p>

<p>
"Better?  Why better?"
</p>

<p>
"More appropriate.  Mrs. Wilson will not feel
like discussing the matter just yet.  If her daughter
is with her, so much the more reason.  She must
be very unhappy, and, if either of us were to visit
her now to offer sympathy, I'm sure she would
regard it as an intrusion."
</p>

<p>
Loretta bridled.  "If I were unhappy, she'd
come to see me.  If my baby were to die, wouldn't
she come gliding down here to make me feel
resigned?  Two can play at that game.  She's been
nice to me; why shouldn't I let her know that I'm
sorry for her?  Besides," she added, with a shrug
of her shoulders and a bold look, "I'd like to see
how she'd behave&mdash;how she'd take it.  I want to
see the house again, too."
</p>

<p>
Appalled as Constance was, she said to herself
that she must not let the shock of this lack of taste
palsy her own effectiveness.  To upbraid Loretta
would only confirm her in her intention.
</p>

<p>
"Let us hope that there will be no publicity; that
the matter will be kept very quiet.  If Mrs. Wilson
is desirous of concealing it, surely she would
not be pleased to know that we had heard of it.
I told you because I know how fond you are of
her, and that her secret would be safe in your
hands."
</p>

<p>
"Publicity?  Of course there'll be publicity."  The
suggestion of concealment was obviously
distasteful to her.  "Why, I read it to you in the
newspaper.  The reporters are certain to get wind
of it in a few days, see if they don't.  And when
they do, look out for head-lines and half-page
illustrations.  The public have a right to know
what's going on, haven't they?" she asked in
the assertive tone of one vindicating a vested privilege.
</p>

<p>
"Not things of this kind&mdash;private concerns,
surely."  Constance sighed, realizing that it was
only too probable that the newspapers, alert as
bloodhounds for the trail of a new social scandal,
would come upon this shortly and blazon it to the
world.
</p>

<p>
"Private concerns!  Suppose a multi-millionaire's
daughter tires of her husband and runs away
to South Dakota to get a divorce as quick as the
law allows, do you call that a private concern?  I
guess not, Constance.  The public&mdash;meaning such
as you and me&mdash;naturally take an interest, and
object to its being hushed up.  The multi-millionaires
have the money; we have the newspapers.
We don't get any too much that's interesting in
our lives."
</p>

<p>
"We don't know any of the facts; we mustn't
prejudge Mrs. Waldo until we hear what they
are," said Constance, ignoring the philosophy of
this tirade in her dismay at the assumption.
</p>

<p>
"That's why I'm going to see her.  I want to
find out the facts," said Loretta, triumphantly.  "I
was only supposing.  Like as not her daughter
has been ill-treated, and is running away because
she has to.  If so, there's not much to worry about.
She'll get her divorce, and be able to marry again
as soon as she has the chance."
</p>

<p>
"But even so, Loretta, her mother must necessarily
regard it as a family misfortune, which she
would not like to talk about.  As to marrying
again, that would only make the matter worse for
Mrs. Wilson."
</p>

<p>
"Worse?  Why worse?"
</p>

<p>
"It would distress her, I'm certain.  It would
be contrary to her ideas of the eternal fitness of
things."
</p>

<p>
Constance recognized her own sententiousness,
which was due to the perception that she had
allowed herself to speak by the card without
sufficient authority.  She had never discussed the
subject or anything analogous to it with Mrs. Wilson,
and to put arguments in her mouth would be surely
a liberty.  Yet her heart told her that the
conclusion which she had uttered, both in its substance
and phraseology, stated correctly Mrs. Wilson's
position.  What suddenly interested her was the
wonder whether it expressed her own convictions.
</p>

<p>
Loretta lost no time in bringing this to an issue.
"Supposing Mrs. Waldo has been miserable and
without fault, do you mean to tell me she'd object
to her daughter marrying the right man if he came
along?  Why, wouldn't you be glad, after all
you've been through, if the right person came
along&mdash;some decent man with a little money who
could look after your children?"
</p>

<p>
"I?"  To the ears of Constance the sound of
her own voice resembled a wail.  Why should
Loretta be so unfeeling as to make her personal
experiences the test of such a text?
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you."
</p>

<p>
Constance gathered her forces for a display of
proper dignity.  She wished to be kind still, but
conclusive.
</p>

<p>
"Mine is not a case at all in point.  I am not
divorced from my husband."
</p>

<p>
Loretta plainly regarded this argument as
flimsy, for she snapped her fingers.  "Pooh!" she
said.  "You could get a divorce any day you like."  She
stared at Constance a moment, then rose from
her chair, planted her palms on the table and bent
forward by way of emphasis with an air both
determined and a little diabolical.
</p>

<p>
"Supposing your&mdash;your employer, Gordon
Perry, Esq., counsellor-at-law, was to make you an
offer of his hand and heart to-morrow, do you
mean to tell me, Constance Stuart, that you
wouldn't snap him up in a jiffy?"
</p>

<p>
"It isn't a supposable case," replied poor Constance.
One can slam a door in an intruder's face;
there is no such buffer for impertinent speeches.
</p>

<p>
"But supposing costs nothing.  Of course it's
supposable, why not?  You're the sort of woman
who's twice as good looking now that you've filled
out as you were at nineteen.  You know well
enough you're growing handsomer and more fetching
every day.  Only a blind man couldn't see that."
</p>

<p>
"That would have nothing to do with it even
if it were true."
</p>

<p>
"You may bet a man like that wouldn't marry
you if you were plain.  But just supposing?  I do
believe you're getting red again."
</p>

<p>
The victim, conscious of the fact, sought relief
in merriment.  She jumped at the impulse to treat
this indelicate effrontery jocosely as the only
possible attitude.  "It's because you're so absurd,
Loretta.  But since you seem to wish an answer
to your ridiculous question&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The sharp note of the electric bell broke in upon
the slight pause which she made to weigh her
words.
</p>

<p>
"Someone for me!" cried Loretta, and she ran
to the tube.  But she looked over her shoulder to
say "Continued in our next!  The offer is good
for a week."
</p>

<p>
Constance felt the inclination to throw the
scrapbook at her head.  The next moment she was
vexed with herself for allowing her equanimity
to be disturbed, and began to rehabilitate the
interrupted sentence.  What had she been going to
say?  It dawned upon her that, curiously enough,
she had not formulated the conclusion.  Meantime
Loretta was going through the functions of
whistling down the tube and receiving the message.
The surprising import of her next words roused
Constance from a brown study.
</p>

<p>
"Talk of the devil!  It's a messenger from
Mr. Perry's.  Somebody's ill and I'm wanted.  The
boy's coming up."
</p>

<p>
Somebody ill!  It must be Mrs. Perry.  The
few moments of suspense which elapsed before the
district messenger-boy arrived seemed interminable
to Constance.  Loretta had opened the door and
the tramp of his ascent sounded leisurely.  When
he appeared he thrust his hand into his breast-pocket
and produced a letter.
</p>

<p>
"It's for Mrs. Stuart," he said, guardedly.
</p>

<p>
"I'm Mrs. Stuart," said Constance.
</p>

<p>
"I was told to ring at your bell first, and if you
was asleep or didn't answer the tube to try the
other lady."
</p>

<p>
Constance read the brief contents of the note
with perturbation.  It was from Mr. Perry,
informing her that on his return home he had found
his mother stricken with paralysis, that the doctor
was in attendance, and that a trained nurse was
necessary.  He had thought of Loretta; would
Constance send her if disengaged?
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Loretta, dear Mrs. Perry is seriously ill&mdash;a
stroke of paralysis.  Mr. Perry asks you to come
to her at once."
</p>

<p>
"I'll be ready to start in a few minutes," answered
Loretta, briskly.
</p>

<p>
"We will both go," added Constance, as though
to herself.  "There may be something I can do."  She
turned to the messenger: "Return as quickly
as you can, and tell the gentleman that we&mdash;wait
a moment."  She tore the sheet of note-paper apart
and seating herself at the table wrote hastily on
the blank half in pencil: "Loretta will come at
once, and I shall accompany her.  My heart
grieves for you, my dear friend."  She folded it
and bent down one corner.  "Give him this," she
said, "and please make haste."
</p>

<p>
At this time in Benham the doctrine that sewage
must be diverted from the sources of water supply
used for drinking purposes was firmly established,
and the doctrine that not every woman able to read
and write is qualified to teach school was being
gradually, if grudgingly, admitted to be not
altogether un-American.  So swift had been the change
of attitude toward special knowledge that there
had even been a revolution in regard to the theory
advocated by the original board of trustees of the
Silas S. Parsons Free Hospital that every woman
is a born nurse, and is competent, after a
fortnight's training at the utmost, to take charge of
the sickest patients.  Those familiar with affairs
in Benham will recall that the original ruling spirit
of that institution was Mrs. Selma Lyons, wife
of United States Senator Lyons.  She disapproved
of special training and was a strong champion of
the principle that an American woman with
aspirations is more likely to be fettered than helped
by conventional standards, and that individuality
should be given free play in order to attain brilliant
results.  Yet though this principle was reverenced
at first in the employment of nurses for the
hospital, progress, that stern derider even of the
American woman, gradually set it at naught
during the period when Mrs. Lyons was resident in
Washington and unable to give that close personal
attention to the affairs of the institution which she
desired.  It so happened that after her husband's
defeat at the end of his first term through the
hostility of Horace Elton, one of the financial
magnates of that section of the country, who harbored
a grudge against him for alleged duplicity when
Governor, the President of the United States
threw a sop to the defeated candidate in the form
of the Spanish mission.  Selma, who was still
engaged in the effort to chastise her enemies and to
reëstablish what she regarded as true American
social principles, was sorry to leave Washington,
but she found some consolation in the thought of
introducing American ethical standards at a
foreign court, especially of dealing a death-blow to
bull-fights by her personal influence.  She was
obliged, however, to relax considerably her vigilance
in regard to the hospital; even, to consent to
an enlargement of the board of trustees.  This
in its new form presently adopted what the
members regarded as modern methods.  Mrs. Wilson
had been one of the recent additions to the body.
Yet, under her regimen, though every applicant
for a nurse's diploma was obliged to serve a rigorous
apprenticeship of two years at the hospital, the
idea of scrutinizing the antecedents and previous
education of the young women offering themselves
was still novel.  Selma would have regarded an
inquiry of this kind as aristocratic and hostile to
the free development of the individual.  Now&mdash;but
a few years later&mdash;such a system of scrutiny
is in vogue in Benham; but at the date of Loretta
Davis's admittance to the Silas S. Parsons Free
Hospital, though it doubtless occurred to
Mrs. Wilson that her candidate was not ideal, she had
not demurred.  On the contrary, she had welcomed
the opportunity of giving the girl a chance
to redeem herself in this field of usefulness.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, though Constance might not have
picked out her neighbor for this particular service,
she felt only thankfulness that Loretta was
disengaged, and that they were able to betake
themselves at once to Mrs. Perry's bedside.  The old
dame employed to look after the baby in Loretta's
absence was still available.  Constance waked her,
and requested her to keep an eye on her own
children in case she were away all night.  After their
arrival at their destination, however, it was soon
clear to Constance that there was nothing she could
do.  Mrs. Perry had not regained consciousness,
and the physician in attendance was non-committal
as to the outcome.  So Gordon informed them;
briefly, and Constance was left in the library to
her own reflections while he showed Loretta to
her post.  She was not sorry that she had come;
but much as she wished to remain, plainly she
would be in the way.  Loretta was trained, and
was the proper person to be in the sick-room.  Yet
she would not go until Mr. Perry returned.  He
might have instructions for the morrow concerning
the changes in his plans consequent upon his
mother's illness.  Besides, she wished to express
more specifically her desire to be of any possible
service.
</p>

<p>
Gordon returned before long.  He put out his
hand as though they had not met already.  "I
thank you heartily for your message of sympathy,"
he said.
</p>

<p>
"There is no change?"
</p>

<p>
"None.  It is the beginning of the end."
</p>

<p>
"Yet&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, she may recover, thanks to the
tireless methods of modern science; but what would
the only possible recovery mean to a woman like
her?  Merely durance vile.  No&mdash;one's natural
impulse, of course, is to hold on to one we
love&mdash;to delay the parting at any price.  The doctors
must have their way.  But when I allow myself
to think, I know it would be best for her not to
wake again.  She would prefer it.  You know that."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, she would prefer it," Constance murmured.
"I must not keep you from her," she
added.
</p>

<p>
"Please stay a little.  I can do nothing.  It hurts
me to see her so unlike herself, though the doctor
says she is not suffering."  He glanced at the clock
apprehensively.  "It is getting late, I know; but
you must not go quite yet.  I will telephone for a
carriage presently.  I must give you directions as
to what to do at the office to-morrow in case I
should not be there."  Then, as though he divined
what was in her thoughts, he said, "I was glad
when I knew you were coming.  I said to myself,
'if my mother should recover consciousness, the
sight of Constance at her bedside would do her
more good than any medicine.'"
</p>

<p>
He had never before employed her Christian
name in her presence.  The use of it now seemed
to her to put a seal upon the bond of their friendship.
He was become, indeed, a wise older brother
whom it delighted her to serve.
</p>

<p>
"But you will come to-morrow?" he said.
</p>

<p>
"If I may.  I should like to be near her.  I
hate to feel helpless where she is concerned."
</p>

<p>
"We are both helpless.  What a mother she has
been to me!  I owe everything to her.  Truth has
been her divinity, truth&mdash;truth&mdash;and she has had
the courage to live up to what she believed."  He
paused.  Evidently his spirit quailed before the
impending future.  "And now she is slipping away
from me.  The common destiny.  But she is my
mother.  I wonder where she is going&mdash;what is to
become of all that energy and clear-headedness.
Modern science tells us that force never perishes.
It is as difficult to imagine my mother's individuality
at an end as it is to convince one's self in the
presence of death that the grave is not master."  He
sighed and turned to hide a tear.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "I know not where His islands lift<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their fronded palms in air,<br />
  I only know I cannot drift<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond His love and care."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The lines rose to Constance's lips and she
repeated them.  They were not symbolic of her
church; rather they were a text from the universal
hope of mankind.  She felt instinctively that any
more orthodox definition would have jarred upon
him.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," he said, softly.  "It is so easy
in this age of conscientious investigation to reject
everything which will not bear the test of human
reason.  Death is no greater a mystery than birth.
We know not whence we came, nor whither we go.
But when the world ceases to believe that there is
some answer to it all worthy of our aspirations, it
will be time for this planet to become a frozen
pole again.  You women are apt to bear that in
mind more faithfully than we," he added, lifting
his eyes to hers.  "Come," he said, "we must not
forget to-morrow; you have work to do.  I must
not be selfish."
</p>

<p>
A few minutes later he put her in a carriage.
In the morning Constance, imbued with his speech,
half hoped that she might hear that Mrs. Perry
was dead.  But Gordon appeared at the office
about ten o'clock, announcing that the night had
brought a change for the better.  His mother had
smiled at him recognizingly, and faintly pressed
his hand.  Though she was unable to speak, the
doctor had encouraged him to believe that she
would do so.  Constance perceived that he was in
better spirits, showing that, despite his words, he
was rejoicing that the parting had been delayed.
</p>

<p>
The improvement in Mrs. Perry's condition
continued for nearly three weeks.  One side of her
body was completely paralyzed, but she regained
presently the power to utter a few occasional
words, though her enunciation was difficult to
understand.  At the end of the fourth day from her
seizure she was permitted to see Constance for a
few minutes.  Soon after daily visits increasing
gradually in length were sanctioned, and Constance,
after her duties at the office were over,
was enabled to spend an hour or more at the
bedside of her friend before returning to her own
home.  This was an agreeable arrangement to
Loretta, for it gave that young woman a breathing
spell&mdash;the opportunity to take the fresh air
or to do whatever she pleased.  Mrs. Perry
evidently delighted in Constance's attendance.  She
listened to reading with satisfaction for a time,
but later it seemed to suit her better to lie quietly,
her unmaimed hand resting in or near one of
Constance's, while the latter now and then broke the
twilight silence by recounting the news of the day.
"I like the sound of your voice, my dear," she said
to Constance.  "It is refreshing and musical as a
brook."  Occasionally Gordon joined them, but
he would never permit Constance to relinquish her
seat beside the bed in his favor.
</p>

<p>
"My turn comes later," he said.  "I tuck my
mother up for the night."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Perry seemed to enjoy especially the days
when they were there together.  She would turn
her eyes from one to the other as though she
delighted in them equally.  But only once did she
make any reference to what may have been in her
thoughts concerning their joint presence.  It was
in the third week of her illness, and what she said
was spoken low to Constance, though evidently
intended to be audible to them both.
</p>

<p>
"You must take good care of him, dear, when
I am gone."
</p>

<p>
It was one of her best days as regards articulation,
so there was no room for misunderstanding.
The words were harmless enough and Constance
took them in the only sense in which they were
applicable.
</p>

<p>
"I shall stay with him as long as he will keep
me, you may rely on that, Mrs. Perry," she
responded, brightly.
</p>

<p>
A pleasant smile came over the old lady's face
and she looked in the direction of her son.  Her
mouth twitched.  "Do you hear what she says,
Gordon?"  There was a humorous twinkle in her
voice, which doubtless was not lost on him.  His
back was to the light, so that he had the advantage
of shadow to cover his mental processes.
</p>

<p>
"I regard it as impossible that Constance and
I should ever drift apart," he said.
</p>

<p>
His sphinx-like reply seemed to be reassuring
to the invalid.  She lay like one serenely satisfied,
and did not pursue the subject further.  As for
Constance, she noticed the use by Mr. Perry of
her Christian name again, but it seemed to her only
fitting and friendly.  She did not need his assurance
to feel that they were not likely to drift apart, but
it was delightful to hear it from his lips.
</p>

<p>
When Mrs. Perry's seeming convalescence had
reached a stage at which the doctor was on the
point of sending her out to drive, a second attack
of her malady occurred and brought the end.  She
became unconscious at once, and passed away
within a few hours.  On the afternoon after the
funeral Constance returned to the house with
Loretta in order that the latter might collect and
bring away her belongings.  Gordon was closeted
in his library alone with his sorrow, and the two
women moving noiselessly through the silent house
made but a brief stay.  While they were on their
way to Lincoln Chambers a newsboy entered the
street-car crying the evening papers.  Loretta
having bought one made an ejaculation.  Absorbed in
what she had discovered, she paid no heed at first
to Constance's glance of interrogation, but read
with an avidity which seemed breathless.  Then
she thrust the sheet under her companion's eyes,
and pointing to a column bristling with large
headlines, exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
"Here it is at last; a full account of the divorce
proceedings with their pictures, and a picture of
her.  It's a worse affair than anyone imagined.
It says Paul Howard and his wife are mixed up
in it, and there's something about a pistol going
off at Newport.  I haven't read it all yet.  But
look&mdash;look!"
</p>

<p>
Loretta's demeanor suggested not merely
excitement, but a sort of saturnine glee, so that
Constance turned from the printed page toward her as
though seeking to fathom its cause, then back to
the newspaper, the capitals of which told their
sensational story with flaring offensiveness.
</p>

<p>
"I won't read it now, Loretta.  I'll wait until
we get home.  What a cruel shame it is that the
press has got hold of it."
</p>

<p>
Loretta gave a questioning jerk to her shoulders.
"I don't know about that.  I knew she
wouldn't be able to hush it up.  How could she
expect to?  Besides&mdash;"  She did not finish her
sentence.  Instead, she wagged her head, as one
in possession of a secret and grinned knowingly.
"I'll tell you something, some day.  But not
now&mdash;not now."  Then she reassumed control of the
newspaper, saying, "Well, if you don't care to
read it, I do.  There are three columns."  She
uttered the last words as though she were
announcing treasure-trove.
</p>

<p>
But the ellipsis had left no doubt as to her
attitude, which led Constance to remark on the spur
of the moment, "Neither of us would like to have
our misfortunes paraded before the world.  I
know what it means; how it cuts and stings."
</p>

<p>
Loretta looked up admiringly.  "When your
husband ran away?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"And your picture appeared?"
</p>

<p>
"No, not that, thank heavens!"
</p>

<p>
Loretta laughed indulgently.  "You're queer,
Constance.  You're so scared of publicity.  I
shouldn't mind a bit having my picture in the papers.
What's more, I don't believe she does.  This
divorce had to come out, sooner or later.  I
shouldn't wonder in the least," she added, boldly,
"if she lets the reporters know when she has a new
photograph taken.  By the way, I went to see her."
</p>

<p>
Constance knew at once what she meant, and
the dismay and curiosity inspired by the announcement
rose paramount to her other feelings of protest.
</p>

<p>
"When?"
</p>

<p>
"It surprises you, doesn't it?  I went on two
of those afternoons when you sat with Mrs. Perry.
And I saw her, too.  The first time the butler said
she was engaged.  He tried to shunt me off the
same way again, but I was too smart for him.
'Tell her Loretta Davis is very anxious to talk
with her on business,' I said, and the message
came back that she'd be down presently.  Between
my baby and my nurse's work it wasn't hard to
find the business, and then I told her plump I was
sorry to hear about her daughter.  At that she
colored up&mdash;you ought to have seen her, and looked
as though she had swallowed a steel rod.  Said
she, 'I appreciate your desire to be sympathetic,
Loretta, but that is a subject I cannot discuss with
anyone, please.'"  Loretta spoke mincingly,
evidently aiming to reproduce Mrs. Wilson's
exquisiteness of manner and speech.  "Said I 'I
thought it might make you feel better to talk it
over with someone.  It would me, I know.'  But
it wasn't any use.  She wouldn't, and she sort of
froze me; and pretty soon we both got up, I to go,
and she to have me go.  However, now it's all out,
and everyone will be talking about it."
</p>

<p>
"But not with her.  I warned you that she
wouldn't like it."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you warned me.  And I don't mind saying
I think she needn't have been so stiff, seeing I
told her everything when I was in trouble.
Anyhow, I saw the house again and her, and now
there's a new picture of her in the paper, and the
thing is going to make a big sensation, if what's
printed here is true, and I guess it is."  She
nodded her head with a repetition of her air of
mystery.  "There are the facts you said we ought to
wait for."
</p>

<p>
"But you seem almost glad," Constance could
not refrain from remarking.  "You stated you
went to see Mrs. Wilson because you were sorry
for her."
</p>

<p>
"So I did; so I am.  I'm dreadfully sorry for
her.  I'd do anything to help her, but I can't; and
she won't let me show my sympathy.  But since
the thing has happened, I'm glad it's exciting."
</p>

<p>
Constance looked puzzled.  "I don't think I
understand."
</p>

<p>
"I enjoy sensations, and big head-lines.  They
tone me up.  You're different, I guess."  A
sudden thought seemed to occur to her, for she
regarded Constance for a moment as a doctor might
look at a patient, then she thrust her hand into
the pocket of her jacket and produced a small
bottle which contained white tablets.  "When
I feel low in my mind&mdash;done up&mdash;I take one
of these."
</p>

<p>
"What are they?"
</p>

<p>
"Something a friend of mine at the hospital
recommended.  They do the work."  While
delivering this not altogether candid response,
Loretta unscrewed the stopper and emptying a tablet
on to her palm swallowed it, then offered the
bottle to her companion.  "Have one?"
</p>

<p>
Constance shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"Well, the next time you feel fagged, ask me
for one."  An instant later she sprang to her feet,
exclaiming, "Why, here we are!  We ought to
get out."
</p>

<p>
It was even so.  The interest of their conversation
had been such that they had neglected to notice
the flight of time or to observe where they
were.  As the car was virtually at the point where
they wished it to stop, Loretta hurried toward the
door, signalling to the conductor as she did so;
but she failed to catch his eye, for he happened to
be absorbed by an organ-grinder on the other side
of the car from that on which they were to get
off.  The car was moving slowly, and, though she
had her hand-bag, it was a simple matter to spring
to the ground without further ado.  She did so
successfully, landing a few feet beyond the
crossing.  Constance, who was following close behind,
heard the voice of the conductor, "Wait, lady,
until the car stops," and the jingle of the bell, but
she disdained to heed it.  She jumped lightly, but
somehow the heel of her boot caught on the edge
of the platform or she slipped.  At all events her
impetus was thwarted, and instead of landing on
her feet, she pitched forward, striking her
forehead on the pavement.
</p>

<h3>
XVIII
</h3>

<p>
When Constance came to herself she was in
her own bed.  It appeared that she had
been carried insensible into a drug store, and
thence to Lincoln Chambers, which were close at
hand.  A doctor presently restored her to
consciousness, but he gave imperative instructions that
she was to be kept absolutely quiet or he would
not answer for the consequences of the nervous
shock.  It was the second day before her countenance
expressed recognition of Mrs. Harrity, the
pensioner who looked after the children, and who
sat sewing at her bedside.  Even then her senses
shrank from every effort, and having learned by
a question or two that she had fallen, and that the
children were well, she lapsed into a comatose
state.  When she emerged from this she was very
weak, but her mind was clear.  She could not bear
the light, however.  Her eyes burned with a
stinging pain whenever they encountered it, and she
was forced to submit to the physician's orders that
she remain in a dark room for a week.
</p>

<p>
Her first inquiry after her mind was able to
focus itself was whether word had been sent to the
office.  She was told that Loretta had done this
by telephone; that Mr. Perry had called promptly,
and that the roses on the table were from him.
Mrs. Harrity seemed proud of the visit and the
gift.
</p>

<p>
"He told me to say you weren't to worry, and
to take all the time you need to get well.  He's
a pleasant-spoken gentleman, Mrs. Stuart, and
wanted to know everything the doctor had said."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Harrity was proud also of the fact that
Loretta had been summoned to attend a new patient.
She was proudest of all of a piece of intelligence,
or rather prophecy, which Loretta had let
fall the day after the accident, which she hastened
to impart to Constance the first moment the latter
appeared able to take it in.
</p>

<p>
"She says as how you ought to get big damages
from the railroad."
</p>

<p>
"But I'm not much hurt, am I?" asked Constance.
</p>

<p>
The dame perceived that she had not lived up
to the doctor's orders.  Yet now she could
conscientiously relieve her patient's natural solicitude.
</p>

<p>
"Mercy, no.  You've broken nothing.  You're
only shook up.  And it hasn't hurt your good looks
a mite.  But," she added, still conscientious, "the
doctor says it's your nerves, and nerves are most
as good as bones before a jury, especially if one
has a smart lawyer handy as you have."
</p>

<p>
Constance sat up in bed.  Instead of being a
comfort, as was intended, the broad hint distressed
her.
</p>

<p>
"I don't wish any damages.  It was my own
fault.  I jumped before the car stopped.  It was
very silly.  I only want to get well."
</p>

<p>
The dread of a tedious convalescence was
already haunting her reviving faculties.  Her
absence from the office would be very inconvenient
to Mr. Perry, and confinement at home for more
than a few days would prove a disastrous inroad
on her resources.  She must hasten to recover.
</p>

<p>
Meantime Mrs. Harrity was looking blank at
the reception accorded to what she had supposed
would be a nerve tonic to the sufferer.  She replied
stanchly:
</p>

<p>
"She says different.  She's ready to go on the
stand and swear against the company.  You're all
right, darling.  Smell them flowers, and lie down
like a good girl.  The doctor says you must keep
still and not talk."  So saying, she pushed a little
nearer the vase of roses, one of which Constance
had reached with her outstretched hand in the
dark.  Constance's impulse had been to detach it
from its fellows so as to enjoy its fragrance at
close range.  But the larger opportunity afforded
her, or else the jogging of her purpose, changed
her mind.  She bent forward and burying her face
in the cool rose leaves inhaled their rich perfume.
</p>

<p>
"It was very kind of him to send them," she
murmured, as though in monologue.  Then
appreciating for the first time her weakness she sank
back upon her pillow.  She said to herself that he
was such a friend that he would make the best of
her absence for a week and by the end of that time
she would be herself again.  But what a fool she
had been to jump; to take such a risk, she a grown
woman with children!  She ought to have known
better; she was getting middle-aged, and she must
be more staid.  Still it was some consolation to
know she had not broken her nose.
</p>

<p>
A note received from Mr. Perry twenty-four
hours later and read to her by her little daughter
reassured her as to his indulgence in respect to
her absence.  All her interest now became centred
on a rapid recovery, and she made sundry attempts
to bring the doctor to book as to the date when
she would be able to resume work again, which he
smilingly evaded.  She was conscious, however, of
increasing bodily vigor, which was comforting.
The inability of her eyes to endure the light was
her chief discomfort, a condition which her
physician appeared to her to ignore, until he arrived
one morning with a brother practitioner, who
proved to be an oculist, and who had brought with
him some of the apparatus of his specialty for the
purpose of a diagnosis.  Constance could not bear
the sphinx-like urbanities which followed the
examination.  She felt possessed by a desire to have
the exact condition of affairs revealed to her.  She
lifted her head, and addressing her own doctor,
said:
</p>

<p>
"I should like to know the truth, please.  Do
not conceal anything.  It will be much worse for
me to find out later that something has been kept
back."
</p>

<p>
The family physician looked at the specialist as
much as to say that he proposed to throw the
burden on him, but he answered, "So far as your
general physical condition is concerned, you are
practically well, Mrs. Stuart.  All the brain symptoms
have disappeared, and there are no lesions of any
kind.  It is now simply a question of nerves&mdash;and
your eyes.  Dr. Dale can speak more authoritatively
about the latter."
</p>

<p>
Dr. Dale, the oculist, a man in the prime of
life, with precise methods and a closely cut Van
Dyke beard, hesitated briefly, as though he were
analyzing his patient, then said with courteous
incisiveness&mdash;"It is a question of nerves, as
Dr. Baldwin has explained.  The nerves affected in
your case are those of the eyes.  Since you have
expressed a wish to know the exact state of affairs,
I take you at your word, Mrs. Stuart.  I agree
with you that it is more satisfactory to know the
truth, and I am glad to be able to assure you that
by the end of six months, if you give your eyes
entire rest, their weakness will be cured, and you
will be able to use them as freely as before."
</p>

<p>
He had rather the air of conferring a benefit
than of pronouncing a sentence, and Constance
received his statement in that spirit.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," she said.  "I will be as careful
as I can."
</p>

<p>
"The condition of your cure," the specialist
continued with polite relentlessness, "is that you
abstain from using them altogether."
</p>

<p>
Constance experienced a thrill of concern.
"Which means?"
</p>

<p>
"It means, Mrs. Stuart, that you must not sew,
read, write, or undertake any form of application
where the eyes are a factor."
</p>

<p>
She could not believe her ears.  "I am a clerk
in a law-office.  My employment is stenography
and type-writing," she said, tentatively.
</p>

<p>
He nodded.  Evidently he had been informed.
"It will be impossible for you to continue it."
</p>

<p>
"But I must.  I must do my work.  My children
are dependent on it."  Her tone suggested
that there could be no answer to such a plea.
</p>

<p>
"You cannot.  If you do, you will become blind.
I am very sorry for you."
</p>

<p>
The truth was out.  She lay dumfounded.
"Blind?  Blind?" she echoed.
</p>

<p>
"But there is not the least danger of your
becoming blind if you obey my instructions.  You
will be entirely cured, as I have said."
</p>

<p>
There was a painful silence.  Her sentence was
too appalling to grasp.  There must be some
escape from it.  "Six months?  Half a year?"
</p>

<p>
"Knowing your necessities, I have given you
the shortest period that I dared consistent with
perfect recovery.  You will have to wear colored
glasses at first," he continued, seeking a business-like
basis, "and accustom yourself to do without
them by degrees.  I will bring them to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
She leaned back on her pillow bewildered.  The
trickling of a tear into her mouth reminded her
that she could not afford to cry, though but for
the presence of the doctors she knew that she
would have burst into sobs.  Her plight demanded
thought, not sorrow.  But what could she do?
What, indeed?  Yet, even as she asked herself the
dreadful question, she began to nerve herself not
only against breaking down at the moment, but
against the threat of the future.  She would keep
a stiff upper lip in the teeth of all the odds, and
be able to manage somehow.  As thus she reasoned,
swallowing the salt of her single moment
of weakness, she heard Dr. Baldwin saying:
</p>

<p>
"You have had a very fortunate escape, all
things considered.  It might have been much
worse.  You might have disfigured yourself
permanently, which for you," he added with a
gallant bow, "would have been a serious matter,
indeed.  As it is, you will be able to do everything
as formerly in another week, except use your eyes.
Your friends will look after you, Mrs. Stuart, and
six months will pass much more quickly than you
expect."
</p>

<p>
"I don't suppose they'll let me starve," she
found herself saying, though the notion of a
return to alms almost strangled her effort at
buoyancy, so that the sprightliness of her tone
competed with the water in her eyes, as the sun
struggles with the rain-pour just before it clears
up.  But she remembered that the room was dark,
and that they could not see her tears.  "Wasn't I
a fool to jump off that car?"
</p>

<p>
"You were unlucky, that's all.  You mustn't be
too hard on yourself.  It is the privilege of the
young to jump, and you will jump again."  It was
Dr. Dale who spoke.  His enunciation imparted a
cleansing value to his note of sympathy, just as it
had ruthlessly epitomized her tragedy a few
minutes before.
</p>

<p>
"But I am not young; that is the folly of it,"
she protested.
</p>

<p>
The oculist smiled.  "Excuse me if I differ with
you," said he.  "You have the best years of your
life before you."
</p>

<p>
They left her under the spell of this assertion,
which lingered in her mind on account of its
absurdity, until in sheer self-defence she said to
herself under her breath that she was only thirty-one.
The best years of her life!  And yet he knew that
she was to be deprived during half of one of them
of the joy of seeing and the source of her
livelihood.  What could he mean?
</p>

<p>
In taking his departure, Dr. Baldwin, by way
of showing his friendliness, had volunteered to
write to her employer.  "I know Mr. Perry," he
said, "and I will explain to him the situation.
Perhaps he will be able to keep your place for you."
</p>

<p>
Constance had interposed no objection.  It
would obviate the necessity of an elaborate
explanation on her part, and would, moreover, be a
guaranty of her later usefulness.  The future
would take care of itself; it was the present which
stared her in the face and demanded an immediate
answer.
</p>

<p>
One solution of her quandary was offered to her
a few days later.  Dr. Baldwin had given her
permission to get up and resume her ordinary
household duties as soon as her glasses arrived, which
proved to be the next morning, as the oculist had
promised.  Consequently, she dressed herself and
sat with her children in the parlor that afternoon,
and on the following day rose, bent on facing the
new problem of existence with a clear brain and
resigned spirit.  If Mr. Perry would save her place
for her, so much the better.  But obviously there
was nothing for her to do in the office until she
was cured.  She must, either through her own
energies or the advice of others, discover some
employment compatible with her infirmity.  She
might have to accept help at first, for the money
she had on hand would be needed to pay the bills
of the two physicians, which would necessarily be
considerable; but with the aid of her friends she
would surely be able to find some handiwork which
would yield her enough to keep her treasures well
fed and decently clothed.  Humiliating as it
would be to have recourse to others, it was clearly
her duty to inform her friends of her predicament,
and invite their counsel.  They would only thank
her, she knew, and she certainly was fortunate in
having three persons, to whom she felt at liberty
to apply, so pleasantly interested in her welfare
as her employer, Mrs. Wilson, and the Reverend
George Prentiss.  Mr. Perry was to be made
aware of what had befallen her, without further
action on her part; but she would write to the two
others, and soon, for the thought was harassing
her that her employer, in a spirit of benevolence,
might try to invent duties for her at the office, and
give her some sinecure in order that she might
retain her salary.  This would be galling to her
self-respect, and was not to be entertained for a
moment.  As the possibility of it grew upon her she
became quite agitated; so much so that in the hope
of heading off any such attempt by him, she
dictated to her daughter, that afternoon, letters to
Mrs. Wilson and the clergyman, informing them
briefly what had occurred.
</p>

<p>
Just after the little girl had returned from
putting these in the letter-box, and Constance was
musing over a cup of tea, a messenger with a note
arrived.  It was from Gordon Perry, and read by
Henrietta it ran as follows: Might he not call that
evening?  He had the doctor's permission to do
so; and she was to send a simple "Yes" or "No"
by the bearer.  Now for it, she thought; he was
coming to overwhelm her with his cunning schemes
for continuing her salary.  Her first impulse was
to protect herself by delay; to ask him to wait a
day or two until she felt stronger.  But this would
be a subterfuge, and, excepting that she dreaded
his philanthropy, she yearned to see him.  He
would put her in touch with the world again,
from which she had been shut off too long.  "No"
trembled on her lips, but the fear of hurting his
feelings occurred to her in the nick of time as a
counterbalance to her dread of being pauperized by
him, and her natural inclinations found utterance.
"Tell Mr. Perry, yes," she answered, and her
spirits rose from that moment, though she resolved
to be as firm as a rock on the threatened issue.  She
ascribed his coming in the evening rather than the
afternoon to his being busy at the office, and as she
put the children to bed she reflected that it would
be pleasant to have an uninterrupted visit.  She
made her toilette as best she could with Mrs. Harrity's
aid, and she inwardly rejoiced again that she
had not broken her nose.
</p>

<p>
Gordon arrived about half-past eight.  The
cheer which his manner expressed did not detract
from its sympathy.  It seemed to say that he
recognized and deplored her misfortune, but took for
granted her preference to face it smilingly, and
not to waste time in superfluous lamentation.  At
the same time, she could not but notice his eager
solicitude and the ardor of his bearing, which was
slightly disconcerting.  Yet he made her tell him
the details of the accident, listening with the ear
of a lawyer.  At the close his brow clouded slightly
as though her story failed to coincide with his
prepossessions.
</p>

<p>
"You see I haven't any case, have I?" she said,
divining what was passing in his mind.  She
cherished a half hope that his cleverness might still
extract a just cause of action from her delinquency.
</p>

<p>
"Not on your evidence."
</p>

<p>
"So I supposed.  Those are the real facts.  I
jumped before the car stopped, though the
conductor warned me, and I heard the bell."
</p>

<p>
"That settles it; contributory negligence.  But
the trained nurse who was with you tells a different
story."
</p>

<p>
"Loretta has been to see you?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  She came ostensibly for her pay night
before last.  But she seemed very anxious to testify
in court in your favor.  She says the conductor
wasn't looking at first, and that he pushed you off
the car just as you were jumping."
</p>

<p>
Constance shook her head.  "She is entirely
mistaken as to the last part."
</p>

<p>
"There is nothing to be said.  It struck me that
Miss Davis, unlike most women, enjoyed the prospect
of being a witness.  It was a great event to
her, and she would be able to do you a good
turn."  He sat for a moment pondering this diagnosis,
then with a start, as though he had been surprised
in a trivial occupation, exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
"But what does it matter whether you can get
paltry damages or not?  I did not come here to
consider that.  I came to talk with you about your
future."
</p>

<p>
He spoke the last words with a tender cadence
which was partly lost on Constance, for she sprang
to the conclusion that the moment for her to
display firmness had arrived, and that he was about
to broach a scheme for retaining her in his
employment.
</p>

<p>
"I must find some other occupation for the next
six months, of course.  I am forbidden to use my
eyes for any purpose.  I have written to Mrs. Wilson
and my rector, thinking they may know of
some opening or vacancy where I could work with
my hands or do errands until my eyes are well."  Then
noticing the curious smile with which he received
this rather impetuous announcement, and
apprehensive lest he might be hurt by her avowed
reliance on others, she added: "And you, too, must
be on the lookout for me.  You may hear of
something which would suit me."
</p>

<p>
"As for that, do you suppose that because your
service to me is interrupted I would not stand in
the breach?  That I would not insist on continuing
your salary until you were able to return to your
post?"
</p>

<p>
"I knew it would be just like you to wish to,"
she said, quickly, "but I could not possibly allow
it.  That's why I wrote to Mrs. Wilson and
Mr. Prentiss," she added, not averse to having him
know the real reason now that it could serve her as
a shield.
</p>

<p>
Her naïve admission was evidently an agreeable
piece of intelligence.  "I took for granted
that your salary would continue.  That was a
matter I did not have in mind in the least."
</p>

<p>
"It can't, I assure you."
</p>

<p>
He appeared entertained by her adamantine air.
"Why not?"
</p>

<p>
"It isn't an absence of a week or two," she said,
trying to show herself reasonable.  "It will be six
months before I am able to work again."
</p>

<p>
"A whole six months?"
</p>

<p>
She met the mockery in his tone with quiet
determination.  "I could not allow anyone to
support me for that period.  Do you not see that I
must find something to do in order to remain
happy?"
</p>

<p>
"Happy?  You do not consider my side.  Do
you not see that a haggling calendar account of
weeks and months is not applicable to such service
as you render me?  How would the satisfaction of
saving the modest sum I pay you compare with
that I should derive from enabling you to get well
as rapidly as possible, untormented by painful
necessities?"
</p>

<p>
There was a strange gleam in his eyes.  She
looked at him wonderingly.  His rhetoric troubled
her, and by dint of it he had managed to make her
scruples seem ungenerous.  But she was unconvinced.
</p>

<p>
"You would be obliged to pay someone else,"
she replied with cruel practicality.
</p>

<p>
"Enough of this," he said, impetuously.  "It
is absurd.  I have something very different at
heart.  When I spoke of your future just now,
Constance, it was to tell you that I have come here,
to-night, to ask you to be my wife&mdash;to say to you
that I love you devotedly and cannot live without
you.  This is my errand.  It is not friendship
I offer, it is not pity, it is not esteem for your
gentle, strong soul, it is passionate human love."
</p>

<p>
He paused and there was profound silence in
the darkened room where they could scarcely see
each other's faces.  Constance trembled like a
leaf.  In a moment the whole card-board house of
sisterly affection fell about her ears, and she knew
the truth.  These were the sweetest words she had
ever listened to, though they stabbed her like a
knife.  "Oh!" she whispered, "Oh!"
</p>

<p>
"Is it such a surprise, Constance?" he murmured,
ascribing her accents of dismay to that
source.  "You must have known you were very
dear to me."
</p>

<p>
The dimness gave her time to consider how she
should deal with this startling certainty, the music
of which was dancing in her brain.  The meaning
of his devotion was now so clear.  Yet she had
never guessed either his purpose or the secret of
her own disconcerting heart-beats.
</p>

<p>
"I knew you were fond of me, but it never occurred
to me that you could think of me as a wife."
</p>

<p>
"Why not?  You are beautiful and charming as
well as sweet and wise, and I adore you."
</p>

<p>
"I liked to feel that we should go on being dear
friends for the rest of our lives," she answered,
tingling with the thrill which this avowal caused
her.
</p>

<p>
From the tremor of her speech he was emboldened
to regard the sigh which followed this
simple voicing of the exact truth as an ellipsis
hiding a precious secret.
</p>

<p>
"Then you love me, Constance?"
</p>

<p>
Whatever happened, why should he not know?
Why should she deny herself that ecstasy?
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, Gordon, I love you dearly."
</p>

<p>
"And you will be my wife?"
</p>

<p>
"How can I, Gordon?  You know I must not."  There
was gentle pleading in her tone and a tinge
of renunciating sadness.
</p>

<p>
"I mean presently.  As soon as you obtain a
divorce?"
</p>

<p>
The ugly word brought back reality.  "Oh, no,
we must put it from us.  It is a delightful vision,
but we must dismiss it forever."
</p>

<p>
"Why?" he asked, with the resonance of vigorous
manhood.
</p>

<p>
"Because it would be an offence."
</p>

<p>
"Against what?"
</p>

<p>
"The eternal fitness of things."  This phrase of
Mrs. Wilson's rose to her lips again as a
shibboleth.  "I have made my mistake," she
murmured.  "I must suffer the penalty of it."
</p>

<p>
"Never!" he ejaculated.  "It would be
monstrous&mdash;monstrous."
</p>

<p>
There was a momentary silence.  While he
gazed at her ardently he was seeking command of
himself so as to plead his cause with discriminating
lucidity.  To her darkened sight imagination
pictured a swift river of fire flowing between them,
across which they could touch their finger-tips, but
no more.
</p>

<p>
"Do not think," he said, "that I have not considered
this question from your side.  It has been
in my thoughts night and day for months.  The
idea of divorce is repugnant to you&mdash;though you
have ceased to love the husband who deeply
wronged you.  You shrink even more from marrying
again because your children's father is still
alive.  If he were dead, the bar would be removed,
and you would not hesitate.  I appeal to your
common sense, Constance.  What sound reason is there
why you should sacrifice your happiness&mdash;the
happiness of us both?"
</p>

<p>
"It is not a question of common sense&mdash;is it?"
</p>

<p>
It was a faltering query which followed the
assertion.  "The question is, what is right?"
</p>

<p>
"Amen to that!" he cried.  "Yes, right, right.
And who says it is not right?"
</p>

<p>
She had been so sure she would never marry
again that she had never sought exact knowledge
of her church's attitude in this regard, and yet now
she had her fears.  She knew that no Roman
Catholic could marry again during the life of a
divorced husband or wife, except by special
dispensation, and she was aware of the increasing
reluctance of the officials of her own church in
this country to give the sanction of the marriage
service to the remarriage of divorced persons; but
she had never examined the church canon on the
subject, for she had flattered herself that she would
never need to.  Discussions of the topic which she
had listened to or read had played like lightnings
around her oblivious head, but had served merely
to intensify her repugnance to the blatant divorces
and double-quick marriages, which she had seen
heralded from time to time in the daily press, and
which had recently been brought home to her with
peculiar force by the events in Mrs. Wilson's
family circle.  Now the flare of the lightning was in
her own eyes, and her brain was numb with the
emotion of the personal shock.
</p>

<p>
"Would Mr. Prentiss marry me to you?" she
asked, seeking as usual the vital issue.
</p>

<p>
"Your clergyman?"  His query was merely to
gain time.  But he loved directness, too.  "Suppose
that he would not, there are plenty of clergymen
who would."
</p>

<p>
"But he is my clergyman."
</p>

<p>
Gordon moved his chair nearer, and bending
forward, took her hand in both of his.
</p>

<p>
"Dearest, this question is for you and me to
settle, not for any outsider.  It must bear the test of
right and wrong, as you say, but I ask you to look
at it as an intelligent human being, as the sane,
noble-hearted American woman you are.  The
State&mdash;the considered law of the community in
which we live&mdash;gives you the right to a divorce
and freedom to marry again.  Who stands in the
way?  Your clergyman&mdash;the representative of
your church.  The church erects a standard of
conduct of its own and asks you to sacrifice your
life to it.  It is the church against the State&mdash;against
the people.  It is superstition and privilege
against common sense and justice.  I should like
to prove to you by arguments how truly this is so."
</p>

<p>
"But I would rather not listen to your arguments
now," she interposed.  "I am on your side
already.  My heart is, and&mdash;I think my common
sense."
</p>

<p>
His pulses gave a bound.  "Then nothing can
keep us apart!" he cried, pressing his lips upon
her hands and kissing them again and again.  "You
are mine, we belong to one another.  Why should
a young and beautiful woman starve her being on
such a plea, and reject such happiness as this?"
</p>

<p>
She drew her hands gently away, and herself
beyond his reach.  "Ah, you mustn't.  If my
church objects, it must have a reason, and I must
hear that reason, Gordon.  I must consult with
Mr. Prentiss&mdash;with him and others.  He is not an
outsider.  He was my friend and helper in the
bitterest hours of my life."
</p>

<p>
"He will do his best to take you from me."
</p>

<p>
She shivered.  "How do you know?"
</p>

<p>
"He cannot help himself.  The canon of the
Episcopal Church forbids a clergyman to marry
one who has been divorced for any cause except
adultery.  The Catholic Church goes one step
further and forbids altogether the remarriage of
divorced persons.  It does not recognize divorce.
A large number of the clergy of your church are
fiercely agitating the adoption of a similar
absolute restriction.  The two churches&mdash;and their
attitude has stirred up other denominations&mdash;are
seeking to fasten upon the American conscience an
ideal inconsistent with the free development of
human society."
</p>

<p>
She caught at the phrase.  "Yet it is an ideal."
</p>

<p>
Gordon took a long breath.  In the ardor of
his mental independence he seemed to be seeking
some fit word to epitomize his deduction.
</p>

<p>
"It is a fetish!" he said, earnestly.  "It represents
the past&mdash;privilege&mdash;superstition&mdash;injustice,
as I have already told you."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no," she murmured, "it cannot be simply
that.  You forget that I am a woman.  You do
not realize what the church means to me."
</p>

<p>
"I remember that you are an American woman."
</p>

<p>
The remark evidently impressed her.  She
pondered it briefly before she said, "I am, and I
know how much that ought to mean.  I wish to
be worthy of it."  She appeared troubled; then
putting her hand to her head she rose, seeking
instinctively an end of the interview.  "I must think
it over.  You must not talk to me any more to-night.
I did not realize how weak I am."  Suddenly
she exclaimed, "Ah, Gordon, you do not
understand all!  I forsook the church once in the
pride of my heart.  I wandered among false gods,
and it took me back without a word of rebuke for
my independence.  I must do what is right this
time&mdash;what is really right&mdash;at any cost."
</p>

<p>
As she stood in the shadow, erect and piteous,
but with the aspect of spiritual aspiration in her
voice and figure, stalwart as he was in his sense of
righteousness, he thought of Marguerite in the
prison scene when Faust implores her to fly with
him.
</p>

<p>
"Forgive me," he said, "for having tired and
harassed you.  It was my love for you that led
me on."  He spoke with tenderness, and under the
spell of his mood dropped on one knee beside her
and looked up in her face.
</p>

<p>
"You may tell me about that before you go,"
she whispered, like one spellbound.
</p>

<p>
"It is not much to tell&mdash;except that it means
everything to me.  It has grown from a tiny seed,
little by little, until it has become the harvest and
the glory of my manhood.  Ah, Constance, we
love each other.  How much that means.  It sets
the seal of beauty on this commonplace world.  It
will transfigure life for both of us."
</p>

<p>
She started.  "The seal of beauty?" she murmured,
as to herself.  "If I were but sure of that!
What I fear is lest I mar the beauty of the world,
and so sin."
</p>

<p>
"It was my mother's hope that we should marry,"
he said, reverting to concrete ground.
</p>

<p>
"I think so," she answered, faintly, pressing his
hand.
</p>

<p>
"And her idea was to do right."
</p>

<p>
"I know."
</p>

<p>
She sighed, then whispered, "You must go now."
</p>

<p>
Rising from his posture beside her he prepared
to obey.  They stood for an instant, irresolute,
then, as by a common impulse, his arms opened
and she suffered herself to be clasped in his strong
embrace.  It seemed to him as he felt her head
upon his breast and her nervous, wistful face
looked up into his that his happiness was assured.
But she was thinking that come what might&mdash;and
she was conscious of a dreadful uncertainty in her
heart&mdash;she would not deny herself this single
draught of the cup of happiness.  It was a precious,
sentient joy to be thought beautiful, and to feel
that she was desired for herself alone by this hero
of her ripe womanhood.  So she let herself go as
one who snatches at escaping joy, and their lips
met in the full rapture of a lover's kiss.

<p>
The news of the tragedy in her daughter's
life&mdash;of the double domestic tragedy, which
included her nephew&mdash;came to Mrs. Wilson as an
appalling surprise.  She had gathered from the
tenor of Lucille's letters that her daughter was not
entirely happy; but her appreciation of this was
derived rather from what she read between the
lines than from actual admissions.  It had never
entered her head that there was danger of a rupture
between Lucille and her husband until the dreadful
truth was disclosed to her by her brother.  From
him she learned that Paul and his wife had
separated and were to be divorced because of the
relations between Paul's wife and Clarence Waldo.
Carleton Howard added that his son had not the
heart to tell her himself before his departure for
New York, and had delegated him to break the
intelligence.
</p>

<p>
When the first wholesale mutual commiserations
had been exchanged between the brother and sister,
Mrs. Wilson realized that she was practically in
the dark regarding Lucille.  Paul's calamity was
so completely the controlling thought in her
brother's mind that, though he occasionally
deplored the plight in which his niece appeared to be
left, he was evidently bent on working his way
through the labyrinth of his personal dismay until
he could find a clue which would lead his mind to
daylight.  After various ebullitions of anger and
disgust, he found this at last in the assertion that
it was best for Paul to be rid of such a wife; that
he had never really fancied his daughter-in-law,
and that the only course was to obliterate her from
their memory.  She had disgraced the family, and
her name was never to be mentioned again in his
presence.  This was an eminently masculine method
of disposing of the matter.  After Mr. Howard
had accepted it as a solution, he was able to
compose himself in his chair and to smoke.  For the
past two days, ever since Paul had talked to him,
he had been walking up and down his library,
champing an unlighted cigar, with the measured
stalk of a grim lion.  Now his brow lifted appreciably.
But his sister's eyes fell before his aspect
of dignified relief.  His solution was of no avail to
her.  It could not answer the distressing questions
which were haunting her.  Why had not Lucille
written?  What did the silence mean?  She
resolved that if she did not hear something in the
morning she would take the first train East, for
might not the child be sobbing her heart out, too
mortified even to confide in her mother?  Thus
speculating, Mrs. Wilson looked up to inquire once
again whether Paul had not said something more
definite regarding his cousin.  She had asked this
twice already, and on each occasion Mr. Howard
had suspended his cogitations in order to ransack
his memory, but only in vain; which was not
strange, for Paul had taken pains in his conversation
with his father to avoid unnecessary allusion
to Lucille, letting her appear, like himself,
an innocent victim of the family disaster.
Mr. Howard was now equally unsuccessful in his
recollection.  Yet while he was speaking, the tension
of Mrs. Wilson's mind was relieved by the receipt
of a telegram.  Lucille was on her way from
Newport, and would reach Benham the following
evening.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson met her at the station.  The
mother and daughter embraced with emotion, thus
betraying what was uppermost in the thought of
each.  But Lucille promptly recovered her
composure, chatting briskly in the carriage as though
she were bent on avoiding for the time being the
crucial topic.  On reaching the house she evinced
a lively interest in the supper which had been
prepared for her, eating with appetite and leading
the conversation to matters of secondary import.
Mrs. Wilson, though burning to ask and to hear
everything, held her peace and bridled her
impatience.  It seemed to her that Lucille was looking
well, and had gained in social dignity, which might
partly be accounted for by the fact that she was a
matron and a mother, partly by a slight access of
flesh; but the impression produced on Mrs. Wilson's
mind was that she appeared less spiritually
heedless than formerly&mdash;a consummation devoutly
to be desired in this hour of stress.  As she watched
her at table she noted with a mother's pride the
tastefulness of her attire, and the sophistication of
her speech.  For the first time&mdash;much as she had
longed for it in the past&mdash;the hope took root in
her heart that their tastes might yet some day
coincide, and each find in allegiance to the fit
development of the human race the true zest of life.
Yet how could Lucille be so calm?  How could she
appear so unconcerned?
</p>

<p>
Lucille's mask, such as it was, was not lifted
until she had been shown to her room.  "I will
come to you presently, mamma," she said, and
Mrs. Wilson understood what was meant.  When
she came&mdash;it was to her mother's boudoir and
study&mdash;she had loosened her hair, and was
wrapped in a dainty pink and white wrapper.  She
established herself comfortably on a lounge, and
crossed her hands on her breast.  Mrs. Wilson was
sitting at her desk obliquely in the line of vision,
so she had merely to turn her head on her supported
elbow in order to command her daughter's
expression.  So they sat for a moment, until
Lucille said:
</p>

<p>
"Well, mamma, I suppose Paul has told you
everything.  Clarence and I have separated for
good, and I am on the way to South Dakota."
</p>

<p>
There was a profound silence.  In spite of the
introduction the import of the last words was lost
on Mrs. Wilson.  She was simply puzzled.  "South
Dakota?" she queried.  "Paul told me nothing.
Your uncle&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You know surely what has happened?"  It was
Lucille's turn to look surprised.
</p>

<p>
"I know, my child, that your husband has been
false to you with your cousin Paul's wife."
</p>

<p>
"And both Paul and I are to obtain a divorce."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson winced.  "Your uncle intimated as
much in the case of Paul.  I had hoped you might
not think it obligatory to break absolutely with
your husband.  Or, rather, Lucille, my mind was
so full of distress for you that I did not look
beyond the dreadful present.  You do not know how
my heart bleeds for you, dear."
</p>

<p>
As she spoke, Mrs. Wilson left her seat, and
kneeling beside the lounge, put her arms around
her daughter's neck.  Lucille, grateful for the
sympathy, raised herself to receive and return the
embrace, but her speech was calm.
</p>

<p>
"It is a mortification, of course; it would be to
any woman.  If he had been faithful to me, I
would never have left him.  But we were mismated
from the first.  We found out six months after our
marriage that we bored each other; and then we
drifted apart.  So there would be no use trying to
patch it up.  We should only lead a dog and cat
life.  Besides&mdash;-" she paused an instant, then
interjected, "I hoped Paul had broken this to you,
mamma&mdash;I want to be free because I am going to
marry again."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson sprang back as though she had
been buffeted.  "Marry again?" she gasped.
</p>

<p>
Lucille spoke softly but with firmness.  "I am
going to marry Mr. Bradbury Nicholson of New
York."  She added a few words as to his identity,
then with an emphasis intended to express the
ardor of a soul which has come to its own at last,
exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
"I'm deeply in love with him, mamma; and I
never was with Clarence.  I thought I was, but I
wasn't.  This time it's the real thing."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson rose and returning to her desk
rested her head again upon her supported elbow.
She was stunned.  The shock of the announcement
was such that she did not attempt to speak.  But
Lucille, having begun, was evidently bent on
making a clean breast of her affairs.
</p>

<p>
"So I am on my way to Sioux Falls to obtain a
divorce."
</p>

<p>
"Why do you go there?"
</p>

<p>
"Because it is one of the quickest places.  Residence
is necessary to enable me to sue, and residence
can be acquired by living there ninety days.  Then,
too, the courts don't insist on very strict proof,
so I can obtain a divorce for neglect or cruelty,
and avoid the unpleasantness of alleging anything
worse.  I thought of Connecticut, where the law
allows a divorce for any such misconduct as
permanently destroys one's happiness and defeats the
marriage relation, but my lawyer said it would be
simpler and quicker to go to South Dakota.  Clarence
knows all about it, and is only too glad, and
he has agreed to give up all claim on baby."
</p>

<p>
The reference to her grandchild plunged a fresh
dagger into Mrs. Wilson's heart.
</p>

<p>
"Where is your baby?" she asked, sternly.  She
had already in the carriage inquired for its welfare,
taking for granted that its mother had been
unwilling to bring it on what had appeared to be a
flying journey.
</p>

<p>
"At Newport.  Two of my maids and baby are
to join me here.  I don't wish to start for a week,
if you will keep me, and, as there was packing still
to be done, and the Newport air is fresher so early
in the autumn, I told them to follow.  You may
keep baby here until I send for her, if it would
make you feel any happier, mamma."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson made no response to this self-sacrificing
offer.  She was asking herself whether it were
not her duty as an outraged parent to rise in her
agony and, pointing to the door, bid Lucille choose
between her lover and herself.  But would not this
be old-fashioned?  Could she endure to quarrel
with her own and only flesh and blood?  Overwhelmed
as she was by her daughter's absolute indifference
to considerations which she reverenced
as the laws of her being, Mrs. Wilson prided herself
on being equally a leader of spiritual progress, a
woman of the world, and an American.  She
recognized that it behooved her to display no less
acumen and tact in dealing with her personal problem
than in confronting the quandaries of others.  She
knew instinctively that violent opposition would
simply alienate Lucille and confirm her in her
purpose.  It was obvious that their point of view was
as divergent as the poles.  How could Lucille take
the affair so philosophically?  How could she
calmly regard the neglect and sin of her husband
merely as the logical sequence of the discovery that
they were mismated, and find a sufficient explanation
for everything in the announcement that they
had bored each other?  Yet Mrs. Wilson
appreciated in those moments of horror that it would be
worse than futile to give bitter utterance to her
emotions.  By so doing she would alienate her
daughter and fail to alter the situation.  Though
protesting with the full vigor of her being, she
must be reasonable or she could accomplish
nothing.  So she put a curb upon her lips.  There
were so many things she wished to say that for a
spell she could not formulate her thoughts.  She
was reminded that she appeared tongue-tied by
hearing Lucille remark:
</p>

<p>
"I was afraid that you would be distressed,
mamma.  That's why I didn't write or consult
you.  You don't approve of divorce, I know.  It's
opposed to your ideas of things.  But I've thought
over everything thoroughly, and it's the only
possible course for me."
</p>

<p>
This complacency was disconcerting as a stone
wall, and made still plainer to Mrs. Wilson that
the offender indulgently regretted the necessity of
explaining and vindicating such common-sense
principles.
</p>

<p>
"It is true, Lucille, that I disapprove of divorce
on æsthetic if not religious grounds.  It is an
unsavory institution."  She paused a moment to give
complete effect to the phrase.  "It seems to me to
diminish spiritual self-respect, and to impair that
feminine delicacy which is an essential ornament
of civilization.  At the same time, if you had told
me that, on account of your husband's sin, you had
decided not merely to leave him, but to dissolve the
bond, I should have demurred, perhaps, but I
should have acquiesced.  I should have counselled
you to live apart without divorce, as I regard
marriage as a sacrament of the Christian church, but
I should have accepted your decision to the
contrary without a serious pang.  But you have just
told me, my child, that you are seeking a divorce
from your husband because you are mismated, in
order to become as quickly as possible the wife of
another man, whom you profess to love.  I cannot
prevent you from doing this if you insist, but as
your mother, I cannot let you commit what seems
to me, from the most lenient standpoint, a gross
indelicacy, without seeking to dissuade you."
</p>

<p>
In conjunction with her ambition to reason in a
triple capacity, Mrs. Wilson was well aware that
the world demands promptness of decision no less
than wisdom from its busy leaders; that the public
relies on the past equipment of the lawyer or the
physician for correct advice on the spur of the
moment.  It was her custom to face confidently
the problems of life which others invited her to
solve, as a surgeon confronts the operating table,
ready to do her best on the spot.  She knew that
the consciousness of being rushed is part of the
penalty of success, and that half the effectiveness
of a busy person consists in the ability to think and
act quickly.  So now, face to face with her own
dire problem, her mind centred on the fit solution
of her daughter's tragedy, she relied on the same
method, yearning to apply the knife, tie up the
ligaments and cauterize the heart-sorrow in
summary fashion by virtue of her past equipment.  So
she spoke with conviction, yet aware that the
problem presented had been hitherto for her mainly
academic, and now for the first time loomed up
on the horizon of life as an immediate practical
issue.
</p>

<p>
Pursuing her theme Mrs. Wilson singled out
for urgent protest the one point which stood out
like an excrescence on the surface of the sorry
story, and put all else in the background&mdash;the
projected hasty marriage.  Its precipitancy
offended her most cherished sensibilities.  With all
the sentiment and mental suppleness at her
command she endeavored to point out the vulgarity
of the proceeding.  How was it to be reconciled
with true womanly refinement?  Was the holy
state of matrimony to be shuffled off and on as
though it were a misfit glove?  She appealed to
the claims of good taste and family pride.  But,
though Lucille listened decorously, it was obvious
that the effect of the scandal of mutual prompt
remarriages had no terrors for her.  Or, rather,
when her mother paused, she disputed it, claiming
that the affair would be a seven days' wonder;
that the world would speedily forget, or, at least,
forgive, if the new ventures proved successful;
that precipitancy in such cases was not novel, and
that the people whose social approbation she
desired would consider her sensible for putting an
end to an intolerable relation and claiming her
happiness at the earliest possible date.
</p>

<p>
From a wholesale plea of what she referred to
as spiritual decency directed against unseemly
haste, Mrs. Wilson, sick at heart, began to
particularize, and at the same time enlarged her
attitude so as to disclose her innate feeling against
divorce in general.  She spoke of the plight of the
children concerned, and in alluding to her grandchild,
her tone was piteous.  The thought seemed
to give her courage, so that when Lucille, who
evidently had a pat response to this contention
ready, sought to interrupt, Mrs. Wilson raised a
warning hand to signify that she must insist on
being heard to the end.  She dwelt upon the value
of the home to human society, and in this appeal
she gave free utterance to her religious convictions,
defending the sacredness of the marriage tie
from the point of view of Christian orthodoxy.
She spoke with emotion and at some length,
though she had never thought the matter out
hitherto as a personal issue, she found that she
had in reserve a whole set of argumentative
principles to back her æsthetic eloquence.  She urged
upon her daughter that if neither good taste,
family pride, nor maternal solicitude would restrain
her, she heed the teachings of the church, which
had prescribed the law of strict domestic ties as
essential to the righteous development of human
civilization, and which regarded the family as the
corner-stone of social order and social beauty.
Was her only child prepared to fly so flagrantly
in the face of this teaching?  Would she refuse to
reverence this standard?  As she evolved this final
plea, Mrs. Wilson felt herself on firmer ground.
It seemed to her that she had welded all her
protesting instincts into a comprehensive claim which
could not be resisted, for, though emphasizing the
obligations of the soul, she had tried to be both
broad and modern.  She had not quoted the
language of Scripture&mdash;the words of Christ
imposing close limitations, if not an absolute bar on
divorce.  She felt that there was more chance in
influencing Lucille through an intellectual appeal
to her sense of social wisdom based on present
conditions, though to the speaker's own mind the
modern argument was simply a vindication of the
precious inspired truth.  But she dismissed the
thought that her daughter was regarding her as
old-fashioned, and she spoke from the depths of
her being, so that when she ceased, there were tears
upon her cheeks.
</p>

<p>
Lucille had listened indulgently with downcast
eyes.  She was unmoved; nevertheless, with
nervous inappropriateness, she turned slowly round
and round the wedding-ring on her finger as she
revolved her mother's appeal.  When the end came
she remained respectfully silent for a moment, but
there was matter-of-fact definiteness in her reply.
</p>

<p>
"You know, mamma, that you and I never did
agree on things like that.  I don't recognize the
right of the church to interfere, so I put religion
put of the question.  As to injury to civilization,
it seems to me of no advantage to society, and
preposterous besides, that two persons utterly
mismated, like Clarence and me, should continue
wretched all our lives when the law of the land
will set us free.  What good would it do if I
remained single?"
</p>

<p>
"Live apart, if you like; but to marry again&mdash;and
so quickly, Lucille, is an offence both against
the flesh and the spirit," said Mrs. Wilson, tensely.
"Good?  It would help to maintain the integrity
of the home upon which progressive civilization
rests."
</p>

<p>
Lucille pursed her lips.  "I shall have a home
when I marry again.  A far happier home than
before; and baby will be far happier than if she
grew up in a discordant household where there
was no love and mutual indifference.  Besides,
supposing I didn't marry again&mdash;supposing Paul's
wife did not marry again, what would happen?
We should lead immoral lives, as people similarly
situated do in the Latin countries, where the
church forbids the marriage of divorced persons.
It ought to satisfy you, mamma, that there is not
a word of truth in the story of too intimate
relations between me and Mr. Nicholson circulated at
Newport.  I told him I should keep him at arm's
length until I was divorced and at liberty to marry
him.  I let him kiss me once, and that was all.
What would a woman in Paris or London have
done?  The church there doesn't seem to mind
what goes on behind the scenes, provided the mass
of the people is kept in ignorance."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson had colored at the reference to
calumniating rumors.  It was clear, now, why
Paul had preferred to speak by proxy.  Could it
be her own daughter who was claiming credit for
such forbearance?  Her first impulse was to
inquire what conduct had given rise to the more
serious imputation, but she shrank from the
question.  It was Lucille who spoke first.
</p>

<p>
"I assure you, I expect to have a very charming
home, and, if I have more children, to bring them
up well.  In a year or two the hateful past will
seem only a nightmare.  Why should you or the
church seek to deprive me of happiness?  In my
individual case our&mdash;your church would marry me
because my husband had been unfaithful, provided
I procured a divorce on that ground&mdash;which
I do not intend to do.  But I am defending
myself on general principles.  As your daughter you
would wish me to have the courage of my convictions."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson sighed.  This appeal to her
independence was discouragingly genuine.  "Then,
where do you draw the line?" she asked,
repeating a formula.
</p>

<p>
"As to divorce?" Lucille shrugged her shoulders.
"The courts decide that, I suppose.  I asked
what the law was, and the lawyer told me."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson groaned.  "The courts!  And,
accordingly, you apply to the court which will grant
you a divorce most speedily."
</p>

<p>
"And with the least possible unpleasant procedure.
Certainly, I wish to be married as soon as
possible."
</p>

<p>
"The law must be changed."  Mrs. Wilson
clasped her hands energetically.
</p>

<p>
"Very likely, mamma.  Now we are on sensible
ground.  But if the law were made more strict the
church would still object.  So it wouldn't make
much difference from your point of view."
</p>

<p>
There was a touch of complacent paganism in
the tone of this last remark which fused Mrs. Wilson's
poignant emotions to a fever point.
</p>

<p>
"It crucifies renunciation.  It is individualism
run mad.  Child, child!" she exclaimed, "do not
be too sure that easy-going rationalism is the
answer to all the problems of the universe.  The
time will yet come when you will recognize what
ideals mean&mdash;when your eyes will be opened to
the unseen things of the spirit.  Before you take
this step I beg of you to talk with Mr. Prentiss."
</p>

<p>
Lucille shook her head, but her reply was unexpectedly
humble.  She avoided an opinion regarding
the prophecy, but her words disclosed that she
wished her mother to perceive that her soul had
its own troubles, and was not altogether
self-congratulatory in its processes.
</p>

<p>
"Of course I would give anything if Clarence
and I had not fallen out, and our marriage proved
a failure.  I can see that such an experience takes
the freshness from any woman's life.  It would be
of no use, however, for me to see Mr. Prentiss.
We should differ fundamentally.  I do not regard
marriage as a sacrament, he does.  You see I have
considered the question from all sides, mamma."
</p>

<p>
"You regard it as a contract, I suppose," said
Mrs. Wilson, pensively.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; the most solemn, the most important of
contracts, if you like, but a contract."  Lucille was
trying to be reasonable, but her sense of humor
suddenly getting the better of her filial discretion,
she added:
</p>

<p>
"Why, of course, it is simply a contract.  Everyone
except clergymen regards it so nowadays.  If
Clarence had died, I could marry again; why
shouldn't I be just as free, when he has been
untrue to me, to regard our marriage at an end&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson put up her hand.  "I am familiar
with the argument.  For adultery, perhaps, yes;
but for everything else, no.  And the Roman
Church forbids it absolutely."  She reflected a
moment, then, as one who has worked out vindication
for an ancient principle by the light of modern
ideas, she added, impressively, "It may well be,
that from the standpoint of the welfare of the
home&mdash;the protection of human society against
rampant selfish individualism&mdash;the oldest church
of all was wise, and is wise, in insisting on
adherence to the letter of the words of Christ as best
adapted to the safety of civilization.  And that,
too," she continued, significantly, "even though the
souls affected sin in secret, because they cannot
override the law.  I do not say," she added,
noticing the surprise in her daughter's face, "that
this winking of the church is defensible; but I
submit that the consequences can be no worse than
those resulting from the flood-tide of easy divorce,
the fruit of unbridled caprice."
</p>

<p>
"And what do you say to the attitude of the
Church of England, of which our Episcopal
Church is an offshoot.  An English woman in
Newport told me the other day that a wife
cannot obtain a divorce from her husband unless
infidelity be coupled with cruel and abusive
treatment, though the contrary is true in case of a man.
A husband can have his affairs, provided he does
not make them public or beat his wife, but she
must toe the mark.  And in England the law of
the church is the law of the land."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson pondered a moment.  "Our Episcopal
Church sanctions no such distinction.  But,
after all, woman is not quite the same as man.  Her
standard is different; she still expects to be held to
a subtler sense of beauty and duty in matters which
involve the perpetuation of the race.  The English
rule seems old-fashioned to us, for we insist on
equal purity for the husband and the wife as
essential to domestic unity.  Yet the framers of that
law were wise in their day; wise, surely, if the
doctrine of loose marital bonds is to imperil the
permanence of the institution we call the family."
</p>

<p>
"But I fail to see the advantage to human society
of any family the two chief members of which
are at daggers drawn, and mutually unhappy."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson recognized that the gulf of
contradiction which yawned between them was
bottomless, and not to be bridged.  We learn with
reluctance that each generation is a law unto itself.
Yet she said, as a swan song, "The Episcopal
Church and also the Roman Catholic Church stand
for, and reverence, the ideals of beauty, of
imagination, of aspiration.  They abhor spiritual
commonness.  They forget not the words of the
proverb: 'Keep thy heart with all diligence, for out of
it are the issues of life.'  Divorce is a device of
mediocrity and dwarfed vision.  It is a perquisite
of commonness."
</p>

<p>
The phrase made Lucille start, and she sat
troubled for a moment.  To be adjudged common
was the most disconcerting indictment which could
have been framed.  But reflection was reassuring.
She answered presently.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure it won't make any difference in my
case; everybody I care about will call on me just
the same."
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, under the shock to her convictions,
Mrs. Wilson had bowed her face on her hands on
her desk, and hot tears moistened her palms.
Lucille watched her nervously, then rose and went to
her, and put her arm about her.  "You mustn't feel
so badly, mamma.  It will come out all right: I
know it will.  I am certain to be happy&mdash;and
though you may not think it, I am much more
serious than I used to be.  Of course, I wouldn't
belong to any other church than the Episcopal; all
the nicest people one knows are Episcopalians now.
As you say, that and the Roman Catholic are the
only ones which appeal to the imagination."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson's tears flowed faster at this
demonstration of sympathy.  She accepted and was
soothed by the caresses, but she was ashamed of
and stunned by her defeat, and could not reconcile
herself to it.  She would make one effort more.
</p>

<p>
"Since you will not permit Mr. Prentiss to
remonstrate with you," she said, "you will, at least,
talk with your uncle?"
</p>

<p>
Lucille reflected.  She had not forgotten the
diamond tiara with which her uncle had presented
her as a wedding present, the crowning act of
many splendid donations, though to have only one
tiara had already become a sign of relative
impecuniosity in the social circle in which she aspired
to move.  The wife of a genuine multi-millionaire
was expected to have as many tiaras as she had
evening dresses.  Lucille was fond of her uncle,
and she still wished to appear what she considered
reasonable.  "He could not alter my determination,
mamma.  But if Uncle Carleton wishes to
talk with me, I shall feel bound to listen," she
responded.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson felt encouraged by the first effect
on her brother of the announcement of Lucille's
plans.  From Paul's report, Mr. Howard had
assumed that his niece, like his son, was simply a
victim of the distressing double-tragedy, and the
news of Lucille's projected hasty divorce with a
view to immediate remarriage offended his sense
of propriety and evoked at once a fiat no less
explicit than his earlier declaration that the sooner
Paul's nuptial knot was cut, and the wretched
business terminated, the better.  His present
words&mdash;that such indecorous proceedings were not to be
tolerated for a moment&mdash;were uttered with the
deliberate emphasis which marked his important
verdicts&mdash;his railroad manner, some people called
it&mdash;and conveyed the impression of a reserve force
not to be resisted with impunity.  The interview
between him and Lucille took place in the evening,
and lasted nearly an hour.  Mrs. Wilson was not
present.  At its close she heard her daughter
re-enter the house through the private passageway
and go up-stairs.  Shortly after, her brother joined
her.  He sat for a few moments without speaking,
as though reviewing what had occurred, then said,
with the plausible air of one claiming the right to
revise a judgment in the light of having heard the
other side of the issue:
</p>

<p>
"Apparently we have to decide whether we prefer
that Lucille should marry young Nicholson as
soon as the law allows, or that she should continue
to receive his marked attentions, which have
already inspired compromising rumors, happily
baseless.  It seems that the object of her infatuation&mdash;a
circumstance which she did not state to you&mdash;is
anxious&mdash;in fact, hopes, to obtain one of the minor
diplomatic appointments.  His father, as you
know, is president of the Chemical Trust and
intimate with some of the influential Senators.
Should I intervene in his behalf with the authorities
at Washington, the probabilities of his obtaining
the position, already excellent, will be improved,
provided, of course, there is no scandal.
If we could shut Lucille up&mdash;confine her by
summary process for six months, until she had time
to reflect&mdash;she might change her attitude.  At any
rate, we should avoid the precipitancy which is the
most objectionable feature of the affair.  But the
girl is a free agent.  We cannot prevent her from
going to South Dakota if she insists, and she does
insist.  She refuses to wait the three years requisite
to obtain a divorce for desertion here; and were
she to allege what the newspapers are pleased to
call the statutory offence, the proof required by
our court would be exceedingly painful.  She
prefers a more accommodating jurisdiction, where
fewer questions are asked, and the tie is promptly
dissolved.  So on the whole&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He paused to choose his phraseology, and his
sister, guessing its substance, interposed:
</p>

<p>
"Then you sided with her?"
</p>

<p>
"On the contrary, I opposed her strenuously.
I expressed my disapproval in positive terms.  But
it became evident to me that she is in love with
this young man and determined to marry him, and
from every point of view I prefer the sanction of
the law to clandestine illicit relations.  Would you
prefer to have her abstain from a divorce and live
abroad with Bradbury Nicholson?  That is what
she intimated would happen if she followed our
wishes."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson groaned.  "And to think that this
is the reasoning of my daughter!"
</p>

<p>
"I will do her the justice to say," continued
Mr. Howard, joining the points of his fingers, "that she
talked quietly and with some discrimination.  It
troubles her greatly that you are distressed.  I
disapprove of her conduct, but I was pleased on
the whole with her mental powers."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  She is cleverer than I supposed," murmured
Mrs. Wilson.  "So you gave in?"
</p>

<p>
"Not at all.  We agreed to differ.  I presume
you did not wish me to quarrel with her?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no.  We must never do that."
</p>

<p>
"Exactly.  In the course of our discussion she
asked me if I thought she ought to remain a widow
all her days, and, as a reasonable human being, I
was obliged to admit that there was much to be
said on her side."
</p>

<p>
"A widow!  She is not a widow."
</p>

<p>
"She chose the word, not I.  She tells me that
you have already discussed with her the religious&mdash;the
sentimental side of the question."
</p>

<p>
"And failed utterly."
</p>

<p>
There was a silence, which was broken by the
banker.  "I advise you, Miriam, to make the best
of a painful situation.  There are only two courses
open: to disown her, or to let her follow her own
course, and put the best front on it we can.  After
all, she is only doing what thousands of other
women in this country&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, yes!" cried Mrs. Wilson.  "And with that
argument what becomes of noble standards&mdash;of
fine ideals of life?  I almost wish I had the moral
courage to show myself the Spartan mother, and
to disown her."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, you don't.  You would only make
yourself miserable."  Having discovered that he
had been checkmated, it was a business maxim with
Mr. Howard to accept the inevitable and clear the
board of vain regrets.  He set himself to counteract
these hysterical manifestations of his sister.
"Besides, it would do no good in this case to cut
off the revenue, for Nicholson has plenty for them
both.  To disinherit one's children is an antiquated
method of self-torture."
</p>

<p>
"I had no reference to money," answered Mrs. Wilson
with a gesture to express disdain for the
consideration.  "I was thinking of my love as a
mother."
</p>

<p>
"You cannot help loving her, whatever
happens," answered her brother significantly.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson acknowledged the force of this
comment by a piteous stare.  She forsook the
personal for the philosophic attitude.  "But if this
loose view of the marriage tie is to obtain, where
is it to end?  How long will it be before we
imitate the degeneracy of Rome?  We are imitating
it already."
</p>

<p>
"I made a similar remark to Lucille.  I reminded
her that the ease and frequency of divorce
were among the causes of the decline of Rome.
Her reply was that we are Americans, not
Romans.  Of course, there is something in what she
says.  Our point of view is very different from
theirs."  Mr. Howard felt of his strong chin
meditatively.
</p>

<p>
"But where is it to end?" repeated Mrs. Wilson
in a tragic tone.
</p>

<p>
He shook his head.  "It is an abuse, I admit;
especially as administered in some of our States.
Presently, when we get time, we Americans will
take the question up and go into it thoroughly."
</p>

<p>
The hopeless incongruity of this reply from
Mrs. Wilson's point of view put the finishing
touch to their conversation.  It was obvious to her
that she could not expect true sympathy or
comprehension from her brother.  It was clear that he
was satisfied with opportunist methods, and that
the precise truth had no immediate charms for him.
</p>

<p>
Rebuffed in respect to the support of both her
champions, Mrs. Wilson felt strangely powerless;
almost limp.  She made no further appeal to her
daughter; the discussion was not resumed, but
when the baby arrived, she reminded Lucille of the
proposal that she keep possession of her grandchild
during its mother's sojourn in South Dakota,
and accepted it.  This was some comfort, and
Mrs. Wilson remained in a trance, as it were,
seeking neither sympathy nor outside suggestion until
after the evil day of Mrs. Waldo's departure.
</p>

<p>
Not until then did she send for Mr. Prentiss.
That the rector could do nothing to thwart the
programme outlined by Lucille was clear, and she
had dreaded the possibility of his advising an
attitude on her part which would induce complete
estrangement from her daughter.  When he came
she was relieved that he made no such suggestion.
He seemed, like herself, overwhelmed with dismay,
and, after he had heard her story, equally
conscious of helplessness in the premises.  Indeed
it resulted that Mr. Prentiss, having realized that
he could be of no avail in the particular emergency,
turned from the shocking present to the future.
Lucille was beyond the pale of influence (though
he declared his intention of writing to her), but
this painful example would be a fresh spur to the
church to take strong ground against the deadly
peril to Christian civilization involved in playing
fast and loose with the marriage tie.  Mr. Prentiss
glowed with the thought of what he could and
would put into a sermon.  Consciousness of the
abuse had for some time been smouldering in his
mind, and he reflected that it was time for him to
imitate the example of other leaders of his sect by
undertaking a crusade against indiscriminate
divorce.  Appalled as he was by the behavior of his
friend's daughter, he reverted&mdash;but not aloud&mdash;to
his previous opinion that it had been a godless
marriage.  Hence there was less occasion for
surprise, and the instance in question lost some of its
pathos as a consequence.  But it provided him with
a terrible incentive for saving others from the
pitfall which had engulfed this self-sufficient and
worldly minded young woman.  His zeal
communicated itself to Mrs. Wilson&mdash;for he did not
fail in due manifestation of personal sympathy&mdash;and
when he left her at the end of a visit of two
hours her favorite impulse toward social reform
was already acting as a palliative to her anguish
and disappointment as a mother.
</p>

<p>
A few days later her brother informed her that
Paul's wife had refused to wait the three years
necessary to entitle the one or other of them
to institute dignified divorce proceedings, on the
ground of desertion, in the State where her
husband had his domicile, and that she had gone to
Nebraska to pursue her own remedy.  Mr. Howard,
though obviously disgusted, finally dismissed
the matter with a sweep of his hand, and
the utterance, "I guess, on the whole, the sooner
he is rid of her the better." But this apothegm,
which for a second time did him service, only
increased his sister's dejection.  The disgrace of the
family seemed to stare her in the face more potently
than ever.  Following within a few weeks of this
information came the disclosures in the newspapers
of the double divorce with their sensational
innuendoes as to what had occurred at Newport.  For
three days she kept the house, too sick at heart to
attempt to simulate in public the veneer of an
unruffled countenance.  Then she visited Gordon
Perry's office, and consulted him as to the feasibility of
putting some legal obstacle in the way of her
daughter's procedure; but learned from him, as she
had feared, that she was powerless.  When she
resumed her ordinary avocations she feared lest the
shame she felt should mantle her cheek and impair
the varnish of well-bred serenity.  It was while
she was in this frame of mind that she was accosted
by Loretta, and the effect of the bald remarks was
as though someone had invaded her bosom with
a rude cold hand.  They froze her to the marrow,
and while, on second thought, she ascribed the
liberty to ignorance, she felt disappointed at the
evolution of her ward.  Such lack of delicacy, such
inability to appreciate the vested rights of the soul
argued ill for Loretta's progress in refinement.
There was no second invasion of Mrs. Wilson's
privacy.  It seemed to her, as the days passed, that
she had been through a crushing illness, and she
felt the mental lassitude of slow convalescence.
The receipt of Mrs. Stuart's brief letter informing
her that she had been injured and was in need of
counsel was a sudden reminder that she had
allowed her personal sorrow to render her selfishly
heedless of all else.  It served as the needed tonic
to her system.  She swept away the cobwebs of
depression from her brain, and with a firm purpose
to resume her place in the world despatched forthwith
a sympathetic note and two bunches of choice
grapes to the invalid, and on the following morning
gave orders to her coachman to drive her to
Lincoln Chambers.

XX
</h3>

<p>
The sight of Constance's colored glasses
stirred Mrs. Wilson's sensibilities, already
on edge.
</p>

<p>
"You poor child!" she exclaimed, advancing
with emotional eagerness, as the culmination of
which she drew the young woman toward her and
kissed her.  This was a touch of bounty beyond
Mrs. Wilson's ordinary reserve, but in bestowing
it she was conscious that the recipient had deserved
it, and consequently she was pleased at having
yielded to the impulse.  Besides having noticed
with satisfaction the gradual change in Constance's
appearance&mdash;both her increasing comeliness and
tasteful adaptiveness in respect to dress&mdash;it
distressed her that her ward's charm should be
marred by so unæsthetic an accompaniment.
</p>

<p>
"What does this mean?  What grisly thing has
happened?"
</p>

<p>
Constance was touched by the embrace.  She
had passed a sleepless night confronting her
exciting problem.  Already this morning she had
listened to the passages in those chapters of the
first three gospels, Matthew xix, Mark x and Luke
xvi, in which are set forth Christ's doctrine
concerning divorce and remarriage.  As soon as the
children had gone to school, she had taken her
concordance of the Bible from the shelf, and heedless
of Mrs. Harrity's wonder, had pressed the old
woman into service to find and read to her the
texts in question.  Constance had not considered
these for years, and had only a general remembrance
of their phraseology, but in the watches of
the night her thoughts had turned to them as
traditional spiritual sign-posts with which she must
familiarize herself forthwith.  Just before
Mrs. Wilson's entrance she had taken up her broom,
hoping that, while she performed her necessary
housework, she might thresh out the truth from
her bundle of doubts.  What if the truth meant
the sacrifice of bright, alluring prospects for her
children, and of her own new, great happiness?
Could it then be the truth?  More than ever did
she feel the need of counsel and sympathy.  At the
appearance of her benefactress her pulses bounded,
and the appeal in her glad greeting doubtless gave
a cue to the visitor's initiative.  The gracious kiss
on her cheek, so unexpected and so grateful, added
the finishing touch to her overstrained nerves, and
she burst into tears.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson folded her in her arms and encouraged
her to sob.  Such philanthropy seemed
to bless the giver no less than the receiver.  She
had arrived in the nick of time to be of service.
</p>

<p>
"There, there," she said, "you are suffering;
you should be in bed.  You must tell me presently
everything, and I will send my own doctor to
prescribe for you."  So, presuming the cause of this
distress, she stroked the back of Constance's hair
and held her soothingly.
</p>

<p>
For some moments Constance made no attempt
to check her convulsive mood, but with her head
bowed on the friendly shoulder wept hysterically.
When the reaction came she drew back dismayed
at having lost her self-control, and as she wiped
away her tears and hastily regained her ordinary
dignity of spirit, exclaimed, "It isn't that.  I have
been in bed&mdash;I had a fall in the street; but I am
quite strong again except for my eyes.  I am
forbidden to use them for six months.  But otherwise
I am as well as ever.  And I have had a competent
doctor."
</p>

<p>
"Not use your eyes for six months?"
</p>

<p>
There was incredulity no less than horror in
Mrs. Wilson's tone.  Constance was herself again
by this time.  She made her visitor sit down, and
she succinctly described the circumstances of the
accident and the specialist's examination, so that
the authenticity of his verdict and the reality of
her predicament were patent.  Mrs. Wilson rose
gladly and promptly to what seemed to her the
occasion.
</p>

<p>
"You poor child.  It is cruel&mdash;disastrous.  But
give yourself no concern.  I shall claim my
prerogative as a warm friend to see that you and
yours do not suffer until the time when you are
able to resume your regular work.  Your employer,
Mr. Perry, what has he said to this?  His
necessities oblige him to let you go, I dare say."
</p>

<p>
"On the contrary, he has been kindness itself.
He wished me to remain; he would have invented
occupation for me.  Then I wrote to you and
Mr. Prentiss.  It occurred to me that you might think
of something genuine which I could do for a living
until I could use my eyes."  Constance paused.
Her heart was in her mouth again at the approach
of the impending revelation.
</p>

<p>
"Leave it all to me.  There will not be the
slightest difficulty.  I will find just the
thing."  Then, suspecting that Constance's troubled look
was due to suspicion of this blithe generality,
Mrs. Wilson bent forward and added beseechingly,
"You will let me help you this time, won't
you?"
</p>

<p>
"Indeed I will&mdash;if&mdash;if you wish," answered
Constance with a sweet smile.  So at this heart-to-heart
appeal she stripped herself of her pride as
of a superfluous garment and cast it from her.
Then she said, "You don't understand.  Everything
has changed since I wrote to you yesterday
afternoon.  I need your help, your advice,
Mrs. Wilson, more than I ever needed it before.  You
do not know how thankful I was when I saw you
at the door.  I have been trying to bring myself
to the point ever since.  I think I can talk
composedly now.  Last evening my employer,
Mr. Gordon Perry, asked me to become his wife."
</p>

<p>
The instinctive thrill which the disclosure of
unsuspected romance inspires in every woman
seized Mrs. Wilson, and with it swift realization
of what a piece of good fortune from every point
of view had befallen her deserving ward.
Constance's tears and need for counsel suggested but
one thing, a situation old as the hills, but like them
always interesting.  Jumping at this hypothesis,
Mrs. Wilson, eager to show that she had comprehended
in a flash, responded, "And you do not love him?"
</p>

<p>
"That is the pity of it; I love him with all my
heart."
</p>

<p>
Then Mrs. Wilson remembered.  She had been
so accustomed to think of Constance as alone in
the world, that in the first glow of interest she had
overlooked the crucial fact in the case.  The
recollection of it was disconcerting in a double sense,
for she suddenly found herself confronting the
same dire problem from the haunting consideration
of which she had just emerged.  But though
her first resulting emotion was similar to that
which one feels at re-encountering an obnoxious
acquaintance, from whom one has escaped, that
which followed was a sense of contrast between
the two points of view presented by the separate
situations, which culminated in the animating
thought that here at last was a soul alive to its
own responsibilities.  Meanwhile she heard
Constance say by way of interpretation:
</p>

<p>
"My husband is still living so far as I know,
and I have never been divorced from him."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson put up her hand.  "I know, I
know, my dear.  Pardon the momentary lapse.  I
am entirely aware of your circumstances.  And
there is no need, Constance, to explain anything.
Believe me, I appreciate all; I understand the
meaning of your agitation, I recognize the luminous
reality of the issue with which you have been
brought face to face."
</p>

<p>
Constance drew a deep breath.  It was a relief
to her to be spared preliminaries and to pass
directly to the vital question.
</p>

<p>
"It would mean so much for my children."
</p>

<p>
To Mrs. Wilson's ear the simple words were
imbued with a plaintive but courageous sadness,
suggesting that the speaker was already conscious
that this plea for her own flesh and blood,
although the most convincing she could utter, fell
short of justification.
</p>

<p>
"It would."
</p>

<p>
Constance ignored if she observed the laconic
intensity of the acquiescence.  She was bent on
setting forth the argument with more color, so she
continued:
</p>

<p>
"If I become Mr. Perry's wife, my children's
future is assured.  My son will be able to acquire
a thorough education in art; my daughter, instead
of being obliged to earn her living before she is
mature, will have leisure to cultivate refinement.
They would become members of a different social
class.  I need not explain to you, Mrs. Wilson,
for it is from you that I have learned the value
and the power of beauty.  I covet for them
the chance to gain appreciation of what is
inspiring and beautiful in life, so that they need
not be handicapped by ignorance as I have
been."
</p>

<p>
No other appeal so well adapted to engage her
listener's sympathies could have been devised by a
practical schemer.  And the obvious ingenuousness
of the almost naïve statement increased the force
of it, for like the woman herself the plea stood out
in simple relief impressive through its very lack
of circumlocution and sophistry.  Except for the
church's ban a new marriage seemed the most
desirable&mdash;the most natural thing for this
sympathetic woman in the heyday of feminine maturity
and usefulness.  Mrs. Wilson felt the blood rush
to her face as the currents of religious and æsthetic
interest collided.  Her brain was staggered for a
moment.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes.  I am sure you do," she murmured.
"But&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Her utterance was largely mechanical and the
pause betrayed the temporary equilibrium of
contending forces.  But Constance received the
qualifying conjunction as a warning note.
</p>

<p>
"There is a 'but,' an unequivocal 'but.'  That
is why I wish to consult you.  I need your help.
There is something more to add, though, first.
Marriage with Gordon Perry would freshen,
sweeten my life, and make a new woman of me.
He is the finest man I have ever known."  She
spoke the last sentence with heightened emphasis,
plainly glorying in the avowal.  "The simple question
is, must I&mdash;is it my duty, to renounce all this?
I ask you to tell me the truth."
</p>

<p>
"The truth?"  Mrs. Wilson echoed the words
still in a maze.  Yet the clew was already in her
grasp, and she delayed following it only because
the greatness of the responsibility, precious as it
was to her, kept her senses vibrant.  At length she
said with emotion:
</p>

<p>
"This is a strange coincidence, Constance.  I
have been face to face with this same issue for the
past fortnight.  My daughter has begun divorce
proceedings against her husband in order to marry
again.  They simply were tired of each other; that
is the true, flippant reason they are separating.
Each is to marry someone else.  Her light view
of the marriage relation has almost broken my
heart.  And what is to blame?  The low standard
of society in respect to the sacredness of the
marriage tie.  I endeavored with all my soul to
dissuade her, but in vain.  I come from her to you.
The circumstances of your two lives are very
different, but is not the principle involved the same?
My dear, if Lucille&mdash;my daughter&mdash;could have
seen the question as you see it, I should have been
a happy mother.  You ask my opinion.  I recognize
the solemnity of the trust.  A blissful future
is before you if you marry, welfare for your
children and yourself.  But in the other scale of the
balance are the eternal verities, the duty one owes
to society, the fealty one owes to Christ.  You
spoke of beauty.  The most beautiful life of all is
that which embraces renunciation for a great cause,
even at the cost of the most alluring human joys
and privileges."
</p>

<p>
Gaining in fluency as she proceeded, because
more and more enamoured of the cruel necessity
of the sacrifice, Mrs. Wilson poured into these
concluding words all the intensity of her nature.  She
would gladly have fallen on her knees and joined
in ecstatic prayer with the victim had the demeanor
of the latter given her the chance.  Her heart was
full of admiration and of pity for Constance and
also of solicitude for the triumph of a human soul
in behalf of an ideality which was at the same
time the highest social wisdom.  If for a moment
her modern mind had revolted at the sternness of
the sacrifice demanded, she was now spellbound by
the shibboleth which meditation on her late experience
had reaffirmed on her lips as a rallying cry,
the safety of the home.
</p>

<p>
"You cannot be ignorant," she exclaimed in
another burst of expression, "that the stability of
the family&mdash;the greatest safeguard of civilization&mdash;is
threatened.  What is the happiness of
the individual compared with the welfare of all?
In this day of easy divorces and quick remarriages
is it not your duty to heed the teaching of the
Christian Church, which stands as the champion
of the sacrament of marriage?"
</p>

<p>
Constance's mien during the delivery of this
exhortation suggested that of a prisoner of war
listening to sentence of death, one who yearned to
live, but who was trying already to derive comfort
from the consequent glory; yet a prisoner, too,
who clung to life and who was not prepared to
accept his doom, however splendid, without
exhausting every possibility of escape.  Though her
face reflected spiritual appreciation of the great
opportunity for service held out to her, and her
nostrils quivered, her almost dauntless and
obviously critical brow offered no encouragement to
Mrs. Wilson's hope of a tumultuous quick
surrender.  She listened, weighing impartially the
value of every word.  But suddenly at the final
sentences she quivered, as though they had pierced
the armor of her suspended judgment, and inflicted
a mortal wound.
</p>

<p>
"Would the church demand it absolutely?" she
asked after a moment.
</p>

<p>
"Our church forbids remarriage except in case
of divorce for adultery granted to the innocent
party.  The language of Christ in the gospel of
Matthew seems to sanction this exception,
contrary to His teaching as expressed in the other
gospels.  But there are many who maintain with
the Roman Catholic Church that the marriage tie
can be dissolved only by death."
</p>

<p>
"I know.  I had them read to me this morning."
</p>

<p>
Though Mrs. Wilson regarded herself as a
liberal constructionist of scriptural texts, and as in
sympathy with the priests of her faith who glossed
over or ignored biblical language justifying
out-worn philosophy, she was glad now of the support
of the letter of the Christian law for the great
social principal involved.  Divining by intuition
what was working in the struggler's mind, and
ever on the watch to satisfy her own standard as
regards modern progressiveness of vision, she
ventured this:
</p>

<p>
"Though the words of Christ seem far away&mdash;though
His world was very different from ours,
as perhaps you were thinking, the human needs of
to-day are a grand and unanswerable vindication
of His teachings and of the church's canon."
</p>

<p>
Constance looked up wonderingly.  Was she
dealing with a seer?
</p>

<p>
"I was thinking that very thing, that the
Saviour's words seem so far away, perhaps He
did not anticipate such a case as mine."
</p>

<p>
"He invites you to suffer for His sake even as
He did for yours."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson had heard the doctrine of the
atonement criticised as outworn, and she was by no
means sure in her heart that it would survive the
processes of religious evolution; yet she felt no
scruples in proffering this cup of inspiration to a
thirsty and not altogether sophisticated spirit.
</p>

<p>
Constance's lip trembled.  "I neglected once to
heed the voice of the church.  I strayed away from
Christ.  When I was in trouble the church sought
me out, helped me and took me back."
</p>

<p>
"I remember.  Mr. Prentiss has told me."
</p>

<p>
"Would Mr. Prentiss consent to marry me?"
</p>

<p>
"He could not perform the service; he is
forbidden.  You could be married only by some
clergyman of another sect, if one would consent,
or before a justice of the peace."
</p>

<p>
It was evident from her tone that Mrs. Wilson
classed the civil ceremony with the ugly things of
life.
</p>

<p>
"I see," said Constance.  "I feared that he
would not&mdash;that he could not."  She sat for some
moments with her hands clasped before her staring
at destiny.  Then spurred by one of the voices of
protest she cried like one deploring an inevitable
deed, "Gordon will not understand.  He will deem
that I am flying in the face of reason and sacrificing
our and the children's happiness to a delusion.
He is a sane and conscientious man.  He
strives to do what is right.  Is it common sense
that I must give him up?" she asked almost
fiercely.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson recognized the cry as the fluttering
of a spirit resolved to conquer temptation.
"To satisfy common sense would not satisfy you,
Constance," she answered with gentle fervor.
"What you desire would be selfish; what the
church invites you to do for the sake of the world,
of the family, would be spiritual."
</p>

<p>
"I wish to do what is right this time at any cost."
</p>

<p>
As Constance spoke there was a knock, and a
moment later the rector of St. Stephen's appeared
in the doorway, a large, impressive figure.  For
an instant he stood looking to right and left,
taking in the surroundings while the two women
rose to greet him, and Mrs. Wilson uttered an
eager aside to Constance:
</p>

<p>
"Here is someone who will tell you what is right."
</p>

<p>
Perhaps she did not intend to smother the
remark.  At all events it was overheard by
Mr. Prentiss, and it suggested to him an appropriate
greeting.
</p>

<p>
"I know of few better qualified to decide for
herself what is right than Mrs. Stuart," he
exclaimed with sonorous geniality, advancing.  "I
received your letter, and here I am.  I am glad
to see that another friend has been even more
prompt," he added, shaking hands with Mrs. Wilson.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I wrote to you both that I had been ill
because I felt sure that you would be willing to
advise with me as to my future," said Constance.
</p>

<p>
She endeavored to take the clergyman's silk
hat, but he urbanely waved her back, and, depositing
it on the table, threw open his long coat, and
squaring himself in the chair offered him glanced
around the somewhat darkened room.
</p>

<p>
"Well," he said, with cheery solicitude, "you
must tell me your story."
</p>

<p>
"Let me explain, my dear," interposed Mrs. Wilson,
and thereupon she glided from her chair,
and seating herself on the sofa beside Constance,
proceeded to enlighten him.  "Our young friend
has had a painful accident," she began, and in half
a dozen graphic sentences she informed Mr. Prentiss
of the details of the catastrophe and the scope
of the injury.  Meanwhile she possessed herself
of Constance's hand, and from time to time
patted it softly during the narration, in the course of
which the rector on his part expressed appropriate
concern for the victim.
</p>

<p>
"When Mrs. Stuart wrote," she continued, "it
was in order to consult us as to how she might
best earn her livelihood until such time as her
eyesight is restored.  This was a pressing and
delicate consideration for the reason that she suspected
her employer of a design to invent occupation for
her relief, which under all the circumstances was
distasteful to her pride.  The particular matter
of providing her with suitable means of support
I have taken upon myself, and the question is no
longer perplexing her.  It has been put in the
shade by another and far more momentous problem,
the solution of which we have been discussing
for the last half hour.  You come just in time to
give her the benefit of your abundant insight and
experience.  Since she wrote to you an unexpected
and appealing event has come to pass.  Mrs. Stuart
has received an offer of marriage from Mr. Perry,
her employer, who of course is aware that
she still has a husband living from whom she has
never been divorced."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson designedly threw this searchlight
upon the past history of her ward in order to save
her rector from the possibility of finding himself
in the same slough into which she had slipped as a
result of inadvertence, and also to place the
precise situation before him in one vivid flash.
</p>

<p>
Presumably what he had heard was a stirring
surprise to Mr. Prentiss, but versed in receiving
confessions he gave no sign of perturbation beyond
compressing his lips and settling himself further
back in his chair like one seeking to get his grip
on an interesting theme.  When Mrs. Wilson in
bright-eyed consciousness of having sprung a
sensation waited to enjoy its effect, he nodded, as
much as to inform her that he had grasped the
facts and that she might proceed.
</p>

<p>
She fondled Constance's hand for a little before
doing so.  She wished to come to the point
directly, yet exhaustively; to avoid non-essentials,
yet to present the theme with picturesqueness.
</p>

<p>
"This little woman's heart is deeply engaged,"
she resumed.  "She loves dearly the man who has
offered himself to her.  His wish to make her his
wife is not only a precious compliment, but it holds
forth interesting opportunities for happiness and
advancement for her and for her two children.
He is, as you know, a man of high standing in
the community with prospects of distinction.
From the point of view of worldly blessedness the
offer is exceptionally alluring.  Moreover she
would be a wife of whom he could be justly proud.
You see what I mean.  I have given you, I think,
all the vital data which bear on the case."  As she
paused she noticed that Constance stirred beside
her.  It had not been her intention to proceed
further, but she made this clear by saying, "I leave
the rest for you, my dear."
</p>

<p>
The next moment the rector responded with
grave, solicitous emphasis.  "I believe that I
recognize precisely the circumstances with all the
inseparable perplexities and pathos."
</p>

<p>
By an involuntary restless movement Constance
had indeed revealed her dread that Mrs. Wilson
was about to state the arguments as well as the
point at issue, and her spirit had risen in protest.
For sitting there intent on every word she had
had time to realize that a crucial moment in her
life had arrived, and that no one else however
clever could fitly express what was working in her
mind in defence of her lover's cause.  When now
the desired chance to speak was afforded her there
was no hesitation; the necessary burning question
was on her lips&mdash;the one question which demanded
an unequivocal answer.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Wilson has stated all the facts.  I ask
you, Mr. Prentiss, to tell me truly if it is possible
for me to marry Mr. Perry without doing wrong,
without doing what you&mdash;the church&mdash;would not
have me do.  I am ready to renounce this great
happiness if it would not be right in the highest
sense for me to become his wife."
</p>

<p>
It was the rector's turn to stir uneasily.  His
soul was rampant over the horrors of the divorce
evil, but his humanity was momentarily touched
by the rigor of this particular case.  He, too, had
had time to think, and his opinion was already
formed.  It had indeed arisen spontaneously from
the depths of his inner consciousness as the only
possible answer.  Yet as a wrestler with modern
social problems he was disturbed to perceive that
this sacrifice on this petitioner's part would have
the surface effect of a hardship which, however
salutary as a tenet of Christian doctrine, was not
altogether satisfactory from the practical standpoint.
Consequently his reply was a trifle militant.
</p>

<p>
Have you as a woman considered whether remarriage
while your husband is alive would be
consistent with the highest feminine purity?
It was a specious attack, but for a moment
Constance did not comprehend.  Then when it came
over her that he was imposing chastity upon her,
and expressing surprise at her restlessness, she
lowered her eyes instinctively.  That phase of the case
had occurred to her many times already.  Was it
an impurity that she, with a husband living, should
love another man?  Was the implied reproach
sound?  Her feminine self-respect was dearer to
her than life.  Yet she had not discussed the point
with Mrs. Wilson, as exploration with the
plummet of conscience of the recesses of her womanly
self had left her without a qualm.  She had even
faced the repugnant possibility that, as the wife of
Gordon, she might hereafter be brought in
contact with Emil, and decided that it could not
become a controlling bugbear.  Yet now when she
raised her eyes again she looked first at her
mentor.  That lady had hers turned toward the
ceiling in rapt meditation, but becoming conscious
of Constance's glance, she lowered them to meet
it, and Constance gathered from their troubled
appeal that she agreed with the clergyman that
remarriage for her would be incompatible with
the highest personal delicacy and a breach of the
law of beauty.  This was almost a shock, and
increased her trouble.  Her reason was still
unconvinced that the objection was other than an
affectation, but the joint disapproval was a challenge to
her confidence.  Still she answered with the courage
of her convictions:
</p>

<p>
"I should like to marry because I am in love.
If my husband were dead, it would not seem
inappropriate that I should wed another."
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-350"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-350.jpg" alt="&quot;I should like to marry because I am in love.&quot;" />
<br />
&quot;I should like to marry because I am in love.&quot;
</p>

<p>
"You are well provided for; you have employment
and are earning a decent livelihood.  You
have friends who will see that your children do not
lack opportunities for advancement.  Is not that
enough?"  He paused and quoted rhetorically:
"Wherefore they are no more twain, but one
flesh."
</p>

<p>
Constance broke the silence by completing the
passage with reverence, "What therefore God hath
joined together let not man put asunder."
</p>

<p>
"Precisely," murmured the rector.
</p>

<p>
Constance slipped her hand from Mrs. Wilson's
and rose to her feet.  Why, she scarcely knew.
She felt the impulse to stand before her judges,
even as a petitioner at a court of final resort.
Though her heart was hungry for permission to
enter the land of promise, she already guessed
what the verdict would be.  If her rector's hint
that the project ought to have jarred upon her
finer feminine instincts had left her unconvicted
before the tribunal of her own wits, it had set her
thinking.  It had brought before her a retrospective
vision of the long fealty of her sex to the
voice of carnal purity, and its twin sister, woman's
long fealty to the church.  She must be true to
her birthright as a woman; she must obey the
higher law whatever the cost.  No happiness could
be comparable to that which obedience would
bring.  Yet another thought held her, and a little
doggedly.  Whatever her penitence for past error,
she had never abdicated her heritage as an American
woman&mdash;her right to the exercise of free
judgment where the interests of her soul were
concerned.  Her intelligence must be satisfied before
she yielded.  Yet even as she rallied her energies
for a second bout, it seemed to her that the
memory of her late forgiveness by the church stood in
the guise of an angel at the rector's side with
grieving eyes, and the charge of ingratitude on its
lips.  But Constance said sturdily and carefully:
</p>

<p>
"I have reread the Bible texts, Mr. Prentiss,
and Mrs. Wilson has explained to me that as a
priest of the Episcopal Church you could not
marry me.  I understand that.  What I wish you
to tell me is whether it would be a sin, a real sin,
were I to be married elsewhere.  The law allows
it, only the church forbids.  Has the church no
discretion, could no exception be made in a case
like mine?  In this age of the world it would seem
as though justice and the demands which religion
makes on the conscience ought to tally.  You
know the circumstances of my first marriage.
Because I made a dreadful mistake, is it my highest
duty to renounce this happiness as a forbidden
thing?  It is for you to tell me.  I must trust in
you; I cannot decide for myself.  My reason
whispers to me that it would not be wrong for me to
consent, but I am prepared to put this seeming
blessing from me if by accepting it I should be
guilty of a genuine weakness, should be helping to
push society down instead of helping to maintain
the standards of the world."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Prentiss beamed upon her with pitying,
gracious approval.  Now that he had recovered
from his momentary access of temper he beheld
in a clear light the reality of the sacrifice, her
touching sincerity and his own opportunity.  From
the standpoint of righteousness there was no room
in his mind for doubt or evasion; yet he felt that
it behooved him to meet this spiritual conflict with
all the tenderness of his priestly office.  He had
learned to admire this lithe, dark-haired woman,
nor was her greater physical attraction lost on
him.  He realized as she stood before him that
under the new dispensation she had waxed in charm
and social effectiveness; and once more she was
showing herself worthy of his enthusiasm.  His
ear had noticed the felicity of her last thought,
and he was musing on the sophisticated scope
of it when Mrs. Wilson's dulcet voice broke the
silence.
</p>

<p>
"I have made clear to Mrs. Stuart, Mr. Prentiss,
that the advanced thought of the church finds
in the words of Christ not merely an inspired
utterance concerning divorce, but the rallying cry
in behalf of a profound, practical, social reform."
</p>

<p>
The rector bent on his ally a discerning glance
of satisfaction.  He perceived gratefully that she
had made the most of her opportunities to till the
soil from which he looked for a rich harvest.
</p>

<p>
"My dear friend," he said to Constance, "you
have put upon me a great responsibility from
which I must not shrink.  But however
uncompromising my duty as a servant of Christ may
cause me to appear, believe me that my
understanding is not blind to the human distress under
which you labor.  You are asked to renounce what
is for woman the greatest of temporal joys, the
love of a deserving man."  He paused a moment
to mark the fervor of his sympathy.  "Were I
willing to palter with the truth, and did I deem
you to be common clay unable to appreciate and
live up to it, I might say to you 'go and be
married elsewhere.  It will be an offence; it will not
have the sanction of the church; but others have
done the same, and you will have the protection of
the secular law.'  Although the Roman Catholic
priest has but one answer under all circumstances
however pitiful, 'who, having a husband or wife
living, marries again, cannot remain a member of
the church,' it might seem permissible to some of
my cloth not to condemn remarriage in the case of
a dense soul as a grievous sin.  But such palliation
would sear my lips were I to utter it for your
relief.  You have asked me what is the vital
truth&mdash;your highest Christian duty.  There can be but
one answer.  To respect the marriage bond and,
keeping yourself unspotted from the world, hold
to one husband for your mortal life so long as
you both do live.  To yield would not be a crime
as the ignorant know crime, but it would be a
sapping carnal weakness, inconsistent with the
spiritual wisdom which has hitherto led you.  It
would indeed help to lower the standards of
human society.  I may not equivocate, my dear
friend.  This is the ideal of the Christian Church
in respect to marriage and divorce.  Invoke the
human law for your protection against your husband
if you will, but he is still your husband in the
eyes of God, and if you wed another you commit
adultery."
</p>

<p>
Constance, seeming like a breathing statue, save
for her odd disfigurement, her arms before her at
full length, her hands folded one upon the other,
heard her sentence and love's banishment.  Already
she felt the thrill of a solemn impulse to bear this
cross laid upon her, not as a cross but as a fresh
opportunity for service, yet she said:
</p>

<p>
"Then the law of the church and the law of
the State stand opposed to each other!"  She spoke
in soliloquy as it were, phrasing an existing
condition for the explanation of which her intelligence
still lacked the key.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Prentiss drew himself up.  "Yes, they stand
opposed, as in so many other instances.  The law
of the State is for the weak; the law of the church&mdash;of
Christ&mdash;is for the strong.  Verily the church
has been magnanimous and forbearing.  It has
resigned to the State little by little control of the
social machinery.  But here, where the foundations
of society are at stake, it behooves her to
stand firm.  The law of spirit is at war with the
law of flesh.  Monogamy is the corner-stone of
Christian civilization."
</p>

<p>
"And hence it is that marriage is a sacrament;
that the marriage bond bears the seal of heaven,"
added Mrs. Wilson ardently, as the rector,
contented with his metaphor, stopped short in his
righteous foray.
</p>

<p>
"If my marriage was made in heaven, we were
ill-mated," retorted Constance.  The thought
seemed so repugnant to her that she revolted at
it.  But Mr. Prentiss, like a true physician of the
soul, was equal to the emergency.
</p>

<p>
"The choice was yours, and you made a dreadful
mistake.  Have you yourself not said so?  Shall
you not pay the penalty, my daughter?  You
thought you knew him whom you married."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, indeed; but I was very young."
</p>

<p>
"May they not all say the same?  And yet,"
pursued the rector, in a tone of proselytizing
triumph, "the demon of divorce lurks at our firesides
and, stalking through every walk of life, makes
light of the holy tie as though it were of straw,
mocking the solemn associations of the family, and
taking from the innocent child the refining and
safe-guarding influence of a stable, unsullied home.
Yet the State stands by and winks at&mdash;aye,
connives at and promotes the foul programme,
rehabilitating shallowness and vice through the
respectable red seal of the law.  Yes, there are two
standards.  As a modern priest I am aware of the
sophistry of the criticism, for who, if the church
does not, will stand as the protector of the home?
And if it sometimes happens, as it must happen,"
he concluded in an exalted whisper, "that the
apparent earthly happiness of one must be sacrificed
for the good of the many, I know that you are not
the woman to falter."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no&mdash;oh, no," answered Constance, shaking
her head.  "It is a terrible condition of affairs,
is it not?  I see; I understand."  She resumed her
seat on the sofa and covered her face with her
hands.  For a few moments there was silence.
Mrs. Wilson restrained a melting impulse to put
her arm around her ward's shoulder in pitying
encouragement.  She felt that it was wiser to
wait.
</p>

<p>
"Terrible," repeated Constance, as though she
had been dwelling on the thought, and she looked
up.  Her manner was calm and sweetly determined.
"Thank you, Mr. Prentiss&mdash;thank you
both so much.  There is only one thing to do&mdash;one
thing I wish to do, now that my duty has been
made entirely plain.  I shall tell Mr. Perry that
though I love him I cannot marry him."
</p>

<p>
"There is no reason that you should come to a
decision on the spot," said Mr. Prentiss, reluctant
to take undue advantage of an emotional frame
of mind.  "Take time to consider the matter."
</p>

<p>
But Constance shook her head.  "That would
not help me.  I have thought it out already.  I
could not consent to sin, and you have explained,
to me that it would be a sin."
</p>

<p>
"A sin surely; a carnal sin for you, Mrs. Stuart,"
said the clergyman with doughty firmness.
</p>

<p>
Constance gave a little nervous laugh&mdash;or was
it the echo of a shiver?  "I had a conviction that
it could never be.  It was a pleasant dream."
</p>

<p>
The pathos of the simple utterance reawoke
Mrs. Wilson's strained sensibilities.  She bent
and kissed Constance on the forehead.  Then
turning to her rector she murmured with reverent
ecstasy:
</p>

<p>
"Will you not pray with us, Mr. Prentiss?"
</p>

<p>
It was a grateful, benignant suggestion to the
sufferer; the tonic which her yearning, baffled spirit
needed.  Divining as by telepathy that the
moment had arrived for just this spiritual
communion, the clergyman set the example to the two
women by falling on his knees, and presently his
voice was raised in fervent prayer.  It was the
prayer of praise and victory, not of consolation
and distress.  He thanked God&mdash;as he could do
with an overflowing heart&mdash;for this triumph of
intelligent spiritual discernment over the lures of
easygoing and numbing materialism.  The outcome
of the occasion was indeed for him an oasis,
one of those green, fruitful passages in the more
or less general dryness of heart-to-heart contact
with his parishioners, the occurrence of which
made him surer both of his own professional
capacity and of the eternal truths of his religion.
His invocation of his God was alike a pæan of
thanksgiving and an acknowledgment of rekindled
faith.  As for Constance, his words were so many
cups of water to a thirsty soul.  Scorched by his
exaltation, the cloud mists of doubt no longer
perplexed her, and she beheld with radiant eyes her
cross, her privilege to renounce what reason and
human passion urged, for the sake of an ideal&mdash;the
higher, vital needs of the human race.
</p>

<p>
When Mr. Prentiss had finished Mrs. Wilson
did not for a moment trust herself to speak.  Her
eyes were full of tears.  She had knelt as close to
Constance as she felt to be harmonious.  It was
a glorious hour also for her.  The steadfastness
of this woman of the people was not only a subtle
personal tribute, but it had refreshed the tired
arteries of her being.  When her daughter had
left her house, secure and cold in the pride of a
revolting scheme of life, it had almost seemed that
God mocked her.  But now the glories of His
grace were manifest.
</p>

<p>
"Constance," she said, "I will call for you
to-morrow, to sit in my pew.  It is Sunday, you
know."
</p>

<h3>
XXI
</h3>

<p>
In saying to Constance that he had pondered
the question of their marriage from her
standpoint, Gordon Perry felt that he had given
indeed the fullest weight to every legitimate
scruple, and believed that, provided he was
beloved, there was no substance in any one of them.
He knew that Constance had shrunk from a
divorce.  What more natural so long as she was
undisturbed by her deserting husband?  But now
that the element of a new, strong affection was
introduced the necessary legal proceedings seemed
a paltry bar to her happiness.  He had expected
that she would demur to the step at first, but he
had felt confident that her acute sense would
shortly convince her that she was divorced to all intents
and purposes already, and that the mere formal
abdication of the fact, however unpleasant
sentimentally was not a valid obstacle.  He had also
appreciated that this repugnance to a legal
dissolution of the marriage tie for the purpose of
becoming a second time a wife would be accompanied
by an instinctive feminine aversion to giving her
person to another man while it was still possible
to encounter the original husband in the flesh.  He
did not pride himself on his knowledge of women,
but the attitude suggested itself to him as possible,
even probable, in the case of one whose sensibilities
were so delicate as hers, for the reason that
there lingered in his mind the remembrance of
shrinking words both in books and in real life
by other women when the same topic had been
broached in the past.  Consequently it was a
relief to him that Constance did not openly manifest
this form of repugnance, and he radiantly jumped
to the conclusion that her love for him was so
reciprocal and mastering that false delicacy had
been shrivelled up as in a furnace.  Was not such
a process in keeping with her sterling sanity and
intelligence?  For a moment he had jubilantly
assumed that all was won, since, after
conscientious if somewhat scornful analysis of the
Church's claim, he had already decided that the
pure religious objection would never in the end
avail to keep them apart.  Nor did the foreboding
definiteness of her opposition discourage him
appreciably.  It merely cast a damper on his
hopes for an immediate surrender, and indicated
to him that he had been premature in supposing
that she had been able to purge herself of
superstitions and conventional prejudices forthwith.  It
could simply be a question of time when so human
and discerning a bride would come to his arms
without a qualm.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless he felt that he must convince her.
Now that he was sure she loved him, the possibility
of losing her was not even to be entertained;
but he wished her to succumb as the result of
agreement, and not in spite of herself, both
because he realized that she would not be happy
otherwise, and because the doctrine which she had
invoked as a binding obligation jarred not only
with his desires, but with his deepest opinions.
Therefore, at the conclusion of their interview,
he took up straightway the cudgels of thought in
defence of his convictions against what seemed to
him the essential injustice and unreasonableness of
the Church's claim.  This necessarily involved
fresh consideration of that claim itself.  That
night before he went to bed he rehearsed the
arguments by which he purposed to appeal to her.  Did
she not appreciate that they were influenced by
no base motives?  That neither lust nor undue
haste, nor covetous trifling with the feelings of
others tarnished their mutual passion.  Theirs
was no case of putting off the old bonds of
matrimony in order to be on with the new, but one
where love had been starved to death, and been
born again by gradual and chaste processes in a
lonely, forsaken heart.  What could be wrong in
such a union?  And were not their own consciences
and their own intelligences the only fit judges of
the eternal merits?
</p>

<p>
Gordon Perry's attitude toward religion&mdash;toward
churches and toward churchmen&mdash;was abstractly
respectful and friendly.  He had been
brought up by his mother in her faith, and the
period of stress through which most young men
pass in early life had been productive of a frame
of mind which was reverent as well as critical.
Not a small portion of mankind in Benham accepted
their religious doctrine on trust, as they did
their drinking water.  Either they were too busy
to question what seemed authority, or that particular
compartment of the brain where absorbing interest
in the unseen germinates was empty.  Some
of the most pious never reasoned, and their docile
worship constituted the cement in the walls of
dogma.  Again, there was a class&mdash;a growing
class in Benham as elsewhere&mdash;composed of
well-equipped, active-minded men who were polite to
Religion if they met her in the street, and would
even go to church now and again to oblige a
wife or preserve outward appearances, for they
were still of the opinion that religion is good for
the masses.  But in their secret souls what did
they believe?
</p>

<p>
Gordon belonged to still another class.  Religious
truth had an absorbing interest for him,
but what was religious truth?  Different
sects&mdash;and they were manifold in Benham&mdash;told him
different things, and each sect proclaimed its
doctrine insistently as vital, if not to salvation, to the
highest spiritual development.  Like many a young
man before him, he argued that all could not be
right, and as a result he presently found himself a
member of that secret society of able-bodied,
able-minded male citizens&mdash;the largest class of
all&mdash;who reasoned about religious doctrine somewhat
in this way: That they were hopefully looking
forward to the time when the controversial
differences which divided the sects into rival camps
should disappear; and that until then they and
their successors, whose number was sure to be
legion, would turn deaf ears to the clashing of the
divines, and attend church in order to gain
strength and inspiration to play their parts well in
complex modern human society, ignoring all else
but the spirit of Christian love.  If it be said that
they and Gordon were not strong on dogma, denied
that the laws of the universe had ever been
suspended to produce fear or admiration in man,
because to believe the contrary seemed to be an
insult to God, and looked askance at certain other
extraordinary phenomena to which the orthodox
cling, it should also be stated that they and he were
heartily in sympathy with every effort of all the
clergy to improve human nature along intelligent
lines, to help the poor to help themselves, to
prevent the rich from misappropriating the earth and
to foster truth, courage, unselfishness and
refinement in the name of religion.  Therefore it
happened that Gordon was apt to take with a grain
of salt what he heard in the pulpit; and now and
then he would play golf on Sunday if he were in
need of fresh air for his soul; but although he was
slightly impatient of clerical sophistries up town,
down town he lent a ready hand in the active
reforms of the city, in the furtherance of which he
had learned to know well, and to admire as good
fellows, half a dozen energetic, enthusiastic
clergymen.  Was not religion one of the great forces
of the world?  Because one could not believe
everything, and revolted at mystical or puerile
superstitions, were the highest cravings of one's
nature to be allowed to atrophy?  So, just as in his
social perplexities, he had sought refuge in
practical service from the conflict of theories, and on
more than one occasion he had been agreeably
surprised by the confidential admission of the divines
with whom he was co-operating that their and his
views were not essentially far apart.  Gordon was
glad on their account to hear so, and was only the
more convinced as a consequence that it was difficult
to reconcile most of the strict tenets of theology
with the modern ideas of wide-awake,
enlightened laymen concerning the workings of the
universe or the best social development of the
creature man.
</p>

<p>
Gordon made no attempt to see Constance on
the day following his proposal.  Impatient as he
was to renew his suit, he concluded to let her muse
for twenty-four hours on the situation.  It occurred
to him that he would ask leave to accompany
her to church on Sunday morning, but reflecting
that it would not be fair to disturb her meditations,
he decided instead to attend the service at St. Stephen's
and walk home with her after it.  Whatever
the New Testament language on the subject,
would she be able to convince herself that the
sundering of such love as theirs would be in keeping
with the true spirit of Christianity?  It seemed to
him that there could be but one answer to this
proposition, and as he walked along in the beautiful
bracing atmosphere of the autumn day his step
was buoyant, for he believed that his happiness
would be sealed within a few short hours.  Ecstasy
ruled his thoughts.  Was not the woman of
his heart an entrancing prize?  Fortune and station
she had none, but far more important for him,
she was lovable and she was lovely; she was
intelligent and she was good.
</p>

<p>
He had attended service at St. Stephen's once
or twice before, and had a bowing acquaintance
with Mr. Prentiss; but he knew well and entertained
a cordial liking for the latter's assistant, the
rector of the Church of the Redeemer, the mission
church in the squalid section of the city supported
by the larger establishment.  St. Stephen's, as the
fashionable Episcopalian church of the community,
was apt to draw a large congregation, especially
when the pew owners were not confronted
by wet skies or sidewalks.  This brilliant Sunday
at the beginning of the social season had drawn
most of the regular congregation and also a large
contingent of strangers&mdash;chiefly women&mdash;some of
them visitors in Benham, but the majority students
and other temporary residents who found the
æsthetic music and devotional ritual of St. Stephen's
stimulating.  Gordon, who was a little late,
obtained a seat in the gallery.  It had occurred to
him that he would be more likely to catch sight of
his ladylove from this eminence than if he
remained below.  His eyes sought at once the
so-called free benches where she was accustomed to
sit, but she was not in her usual place.  After
repeated scrutiny of the rows of faces had convinced
him of this, he concluded dejectedly that she had
not come.  Perhaps she had stayed at home
hoping he would call.  Or had she been loth to
display her glasses in public before she had become
accustomed to the disfigurement?  His glance
wandered over the rich flower garden of autumn
bonnets, but to no purpose.  While in perplexity
he reviewed the probable causes of her absence
he became aware that the music of the processional
had ceased and that Mr. Prentiss was speaking.
Ten minutes later, when the congregation rose to
take part in the selection from the Psalms, his
glance fell on Mrs. Randolph Wilson in one of
the front pews.  Her profile was almost in a line
with his vision.  While he looked his heart gave
a bound, for he suddenly recognized that the
young woman next to her in the gay, attractive
bonnet was she for the sight of whom his soul was
yearning.
</p>

<p>
After leaving Constance on the day of their
eventful interview, Mrs. Wilson had conceived
the plan of presenting her with a new bonnet and
jacket.  These she brought with her to Lincoln
Chambers a little before church time, and placed
with her own hands on the surprised recipient.
Pleased at the æsthetic progress of her ward, she
seized this opportunity to promote it, and also to
cater to her own generous instincts at a time when
to indulge them was not likely to cause offence.
Though astonished, Constance accepted without
demur these welcome additions to her toilet, and
the donor had the satisfaction of beholding how
admirably they became her.  Besides, Mrs. Wilson
had on the tip of her tongue and was eager to
communicate the plan which she had been working
out since they separated, and which she imparted
to Constance as soon as they were in her brougham
on the way to church.
</p>

<p>
"I have been carefully considering your affairs,
my dear, and, in the first place, you are to do
nothing for the next six months but get well.  I
shall insist upon looking after you.  You promised
me, remember."  She paused as though she half
expected to encounter opposition to this project,
and, though her ward revealed no insubordination,
she added the argument which she held in reserve:
"For, having deprived you by its counsel of the
means of support, it is the Church's duty, and my
privilege as a disciple of the Church's cause, to
watch over you until you are able to provide for
yourself.  At the end of the six months, when
your eyes are strong again, I wish you to become
my private secretary."
</p>

<p>
On the way from her house she had pictured to
herself the astonishment and delight which such
an unexpected and splendid proposition must
necessarily inspire, and she could not refrain from
stealing a sidelong glance at Constance in order
to observe the effect it would have on her.
</p>

<p>
"Your private secretary?"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson felt rewarded by the incredulous
bewilderment conveyed by the interrogatory, and
hastened to explain her benefaction.  "It seems
almost the interposition of Providence in your
behalf," she added.  "Last evening&mdash;and I was
thinking of your noble resolution at the time&mdash;my
secretary came in to inform me that she was
engaged to be married, and to ask me to be on the
lookout for someone else.  'The very place for
Constance Stuart,' I said to myself at once.  'What
could suit her better?  And what an admirable
arrangement it will be for me!'  For, after
refusing Mr. Perry's offer, I take for granted that,
even when your eyesight is restored, the continuance
of your present business relations would be
out of the question."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes; entirely so," answered Constance
with rueful promptness.  "I could not continue
in his employment; we should both be unhappy."  She
was making a confession of what she had been
saying to herself all the morning.
</p>

<p>
"Exactly."  Mrs. Wilson beamed over the
success of her divination.
</p>

<p>
"Then we will consider it settled.  And I wish
to tell you besides that I shall take it upon myself
to see that your boy's artistic gift is given full
opportunity for expression, and your daughter
thoroughly educated.  Your salary, I mean, will be
sufficient to enable you to give them proper
advantages, for I can see that you will be very useful
to me."
</p>

<p>
She was determined to make plain that virtue in
this case was to be its own reward, and that the
material losses in the wake of renunciation were
rapidly being eliminated.  At the same time she
wished to conceal a too obviously eleemosynary
intent.
</p>

<p>
"I don't see how anything could be nicer for
me.  And if you think that I should suit&mdash;that I
could perform the duties properly&mdash;I shall be
thankful for the position," answered poor Constance.
</p>

<p>
She had passed another sleepless night.  Fixed
as was her conviction that separation from her
lover was inevitable, she felt deeply sorry for him
if not for herself, and dreaded the impending final
interview between them.  Despite her spiritual
exaltation the consciousness that she was letting slip
a great chance for her children still haunted her,
in that the future by comparison seemed vague and
forbidding.  For it had been clear to her from the
moment of her decision that under no consideration
could she remain in Gordon's office.  Therefore,
though doubtless her friends would help her,
the struggle for a livelihood must be begun again.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson's amazing, timely offer lifted a
great weight from her heart; by it the question of
her future employment was disposed of, and
disposed of in a way more congenial to her than any
she could have imagined possible.  It did indeed
seem providential that the vacancy should have
occurred at this time, and she realized that the
certainty that her children would be protected would
nerve her for the necessary ordeal of parting, for
now there was only selfishness in her desire for
marriage.  She longed for it to be over with that
she might put away once and forever this great
temptation.
</p>

<p>
The thought that Gordon would probably come
for his answer that afternoon was uppermost in
her mind during the service; but she was in a mood
to respond to the beautiful music, and before
Mr. Prentiss gave out the text of the sermon she was
already thrilling with the joy of her sacrifice on
the altar of faith.  She prayed that she might be
granted strength to renounce this seeming blessing
ungrudgingly and to close her ears to the whispers
of regret, and as she joined in the jubilant
anthem of rejoicing for a risen Lord it seemed to
her that the angel of peace brushed her forehead
with the wings of heaven's love.  The text was
"Except a man be born again he shall not enter
into the kingdom of heaven."  It was a sermon of
immortality and hope, and a sermon of the
triumph of the spirit over the flesh for the sake of a
Christ who had set the great example and conquered
self through suffering.  It was one of Mr. Prentiss's
most happy efforts from the standpoint
of orthodoxy, graphic, eloquent, and practical.
He set no narrow limits of a creed as the arbiter
of truth, but declared that the opportunity to
choose between the path of righteousness and the
path of self-sufficiency or self-indulgence was
offered to every one in the great struggle of modern
life; that he who would follow the blessed Lord
and Master must shun as evil that which was
injurious to the highest interests of human society
and thus hateful to God.  As she listened
Constance could not doubt that he had her in mind.
It seemed to her that more than once his glance
rested on her encouragingly and fondly.  Her
brain was transported with ecstasy and zeal.  Her
opportunity was at hand, and she would serve
Christ and mankind faithfully.
</p>

<p>
Leaving the church under the spell of the
sermon, she became suddenly aware that her lover
was beside her and was suggesting that he escort
her home.  At sight of him her chaperone,
scenting danger, led the way sedulously toward the
brougham, but in the interval Constance decided
to take him at his word.  Would it not be the
simplest course to explain to him quietly on the
street that what he asked her was impossible, and
thus avoid the pain of a more intimate parting?
Therefore she made her excuses to Mrs. Wilson,
pleading the radiance of the day and her need of
fresh air.  She felt so sure of herself that, though
she noticed her friend seemed disappointed, it did
not occur to her that it was from concern as to the
result of the interview until she heard a whispered
"Be firm."  Constance turned a resolute face
toward her, and by a close pressure of the hand
gave the desired assurance, then as the stylish
equipage rolled away from the church door, she
stepped to Gordon's side, sadly conscious that this
was to be their last walk together.
</p>

<p>
Three days later, in the evening, Gordon Perry
rang at the house of the Rev. George Prentiss, the
comfortable looking and architecturally pleasing
rectory in the neighborhood of St. Stephen's.  A
trim maid ushered him into an ante-room where
all parochial visitors were first shown, and asked
for his name.  There was a nondescript elderly
woman in black ahead of him.  In his capacity
as rector of a large parish, Mr. Prentiss followed
the modern methods of other busy professional
men.  An electric bell at his desk notified the
servant that the interview with the last comer was
at an end and that the next in order was to be
introduced.  Gordon had not long to wait.  His
remaining predecessor's stay was brief.  The
rector's heartiness was almost apologetic as he strode
a pace or two forward to greet his visitor.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Perry, I am very glad to see you.  I am
sorry that you should have been kept waiting.  But
the clergy cannot afford to be unbusiness-like, can
they?  We intend to live down that taunt.  So my
rule is 'first come, first served.'"
</p>

<p>
"The only proper rule, I am sure."
</p>

<p>
It was a spacious, well-filled room, the manifest
workshop of an industrious man, but furnished
with an eye to æsthetic appropriateness as well as
utility.  Red leather chairs and lounges of goodly
proportions, two symmetrical, carved tables
covered with documents, books, and pamphlets, warm
curtains, an open wood fire, a globe, sundry busts
and framed photographs of celebrities, mainly
clerical, including a large one of Phillips Brooks
and another of Abraham Lincoln, were its
distinguishing characteristics.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Prentiss stepped to one of the tables and
opening an oblong Japanese box drew out a
handful of cigars.
</p>

<p>
"Will you smoke, Mr. Perry?" he asked, cheerily.
</p>

<p>
Gordon took one, and the clergyman, who
reserved his use of tobacco for occasions when by so
doing he might hope to make clearer that he was
human, did the same.  As soon as they were lit,
Mr. Prentiss with a sweep of his hand indicated
two easy chairs on either side of the fire, but after
his guest was seated he himself stood with his back
to the mantel-piece, his hands behind him, the
commanding affable figure of a good fellow.  Still he
chose to show at the same time what was in his
heart at the moment coincident with his manifestations
of secular hospitality.
</p>

<p>
"That woman who just went out has recently
buried her only son, the joy and prop of her old
age.  She came to thank me for a trifling donation
I had sent her.  Her courage and her trust were
beautiful to witness.  These humble lives often
furnish the most eloquent testimonials of the
eternal realities."  He spoke with the enthusiasm of
his calling, as a doctor or a lawyer might have set
before an acquaintance an interesting case.  He
liked to feel that he was on the same footing with
the world of men as they, with respect to privileges
no less than responsibilities.  For an instant he
seemed to muse on the experience, then briskly
recurring to the immediate situation said:
</p>

<p>
"But what can I do for you, Mr. Perry?  My
assistant, Mr. Starkworth, tells me that you take
an active personal interest in the social problems
of our community."
</p>

<p>
This bland presumption of ignorance as to the
cause of his visit made Gordon smile.  He could
not but suspect that it was artificial.  Yet the
inquiry was by no means hypocritical; for though
Mr. Prentiss was fully conscious of his caller's
identity, and had given him a correspondingly
genial reception, he regarded the episode of the
proposed marriage as so completely closed by
Constance's decision that he did not choose to
believe that Gordon had come for the unseemly
purpose of reviving it.  It seemed to him far more
probable that his advice or assistance was sought
in some humanitarian or civic cause.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Gordon slowly, enjoying the
development of the opening which occurred to him,
"Mr. Starkworth and I have co-operated from
time to time, with mutual liking, I think.  It is in
regard to a social problem that I have come to
consult you this evening."
</p>

<p>
"Ah," said the rector, relieved in spite of his
belief, and thereupon he settled himself in the
other capacious easy chair and turned a cordially
attentive countenance to his guest.  "You may
feel assured of my interest in anything of that
kind."
</p>

<p>
"It concerns my own marriage," said Gordon.
</p>

<p>
The challenge was so unmistakable, like a
gauntlet thrown at his feet, that Mr. Prentiss was
for an instant disconcerted, then irritated.  But the
pleasant manner of his opponent negatived the
aroused suspicion that effrontery lurked behind this
slightly sardonic introduction, and he met the
attack with a grave but supple dignity.
</p>

<p>
"Indeed," he said.  "I shall be very glad to
hear what you have to say, Mr. Perry."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap22"></a></p>

<h3>
XXII
</h3>

<p>
Gordon drew deeply several times at his
cigar, then laid it on the bronze tray for
ashes within reach, as though he felt that it might
profane his thought.
</p>

<p>
"I come to you to-night, Mr. Prentiss, as man
to man, knowing that you wish truth and justice
to prevail, and asking you to believe that I desire
the same.  We are both of us men of affairs in the
modern sense."
</p>

<p>
The rector bowed.
</p>

<p>
"Then you as the rector of one of the most
influential churches in the city will doubtless agree
that religion must be sane and reasonable in its
demands to-day or it will lose more followers
among the educated&mdash;and education is constantly
spreading&mdash;than it gains from the ignorant and
superstitious?"
</p>

<p>
"Assuredly."
</p>

<p>
"I, on my side, as a layman&mdash;whatever our
differences of precise faith and dogma&mdash;am glad to
bear witness that the present social world could do
without true religion less than ever before."
</p>

<p>
The summary pleased Mr. Prentiss.  It was
reasonable and progressive.  "We are entirely in
accord there," he answered heartily.
</p>

<p>
"As I supposed.  Then it obviates the necessity
of feeling my way.  With some clergymen I
should not venture to take anything unorthodox
for granted, but I believed that we should readily
find a common ground of agreement."
</p>

<p>
The assertion was regarded by Mr. Prentiss as
a compliment.  Nevertheless he perceived that it
behooved him to mark the limits of his liberality.
</p>

<p>
"The essence of Christianity has nothing to fear
either from the higher criticism or the modern
world's lack of interest in moribund dogma.  May
I not say with Paul 'but this one thing I do,
forgetting those things which are behind, and
reaching forth to those things which are before'?"
</p>

<p>
"And from that point of view may I ask why
you have felt constrained to separate Mrs. Stuart
and me?"
</p>

<p>
There was a brief pause.  The rector had not
the remotest intention of shirking responsibility,
but he wished the precise truth to appear.
</p>

<p>
"It was Mrs. Stuart's own decision."
</p>

<p>
"I asked her in good faith, after an attachment
of several years, to become my wife.  She loves
me fondly, as I do her.  She would have married
me had you not convinced her that to do so would
be a sin."
</p>

<p>
"I told Mrs. Stuart that from the standpoint of
her highest duty as a Christian woman, it would be
a sin.  Not unpardonable sin, if finite intelligence
may venture to distinguish the grades of human
error, but conduct incompatible with the highest
spirituality&mdash;and modern spirituality, Mr. Perry."
</p>

<p>
There was a doughty ring to the rector's tone,
betokening that he was not averse to crossing
swords with his visitor.
</p>

<p>
"Why would it be a sin?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Prentiss knocked the ash from his cigar and
held up the glowing tip.  "Do you not know?" he
asked, fixing his gaze squarely on his antagonist, so
that he seemed to attack instead of defend.
</p>

<p>
"Because she has a husband living&mdash;a brute of
a husband who, after dragging her down, deserted
her shamefully; a husband whom she has ceased
to love and from whom the law of this community
would grant her a divorce."
</p>

<p>
"Proceed."
</p>

<p>
"Because the Church has seen fit to stigmatize
as evil that which the State sanctions in a matter
vitally affecting the earthly happiness of the human
sexes."
</p>

<p>
Waiting briefly to make sure that the indictment
was complete, Mr. Prentiss rejoined dryly:
"You state the case accurately.  My answer is that
the Church is merely inculcating the precepts of the
Saviour of mankind."
</p>

<p>
Gordon drew a deep breath.  He rejoiced in his
opportunity.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Prentiss," he said, "you referred just now
to the world's lack of interest in moribund dogma;
we agreed that the demands of religion to-day must
be sane and reasonable.  I speak with entire
reverence, but I ask whether you honestly believe that
the few casual sentences which Christ is reported
to have uttered thousands of years ago in Palestine
in regard to man's putting away his wife
should control complicated modern human society&mdash;the
Christian civilization of to-day&mdash;so as to
preclude a pure woman like Mrs. Stuart, under the
existing circumstances, from obtaining happiness
for herself and her children by becoming my wife?
I ask you as an intelligent human being and a just
man if this is your opinion?"
</p>

<p>
There was no hesitation on the rector's part; on
the contrary, firm alacrity.
</p>

<p>
"It is."
</p>

<p>
"And yet you know that a large portion of the
civilized world ignores the doctrine," answered
Gordon, curbing his disappointment.  He had not
expected to encounter this stone wall.
</p>

<p>
"I do, to its shame and detriment.  The Church
is not responsible for that."
</p>

<p>
"Then your argument rests on the letter of
Christ's words?"
</p>

<p>
"It does and it does not."  There was triumph
in the rector's voice as he laid emphasis on the
qualifying negation.  He had hoped to lead his
censor to this very point.  "Nor does the spiritual
objection of the woman who has refused to marry
you rest solely on that ground.  She is an
intelligent person, Mr. Perry.  She perceives, as I
perceive, that what you ask her to consent to do would
be evil for the human race as well as contrary to
the teachings of our Lord.  There is nothing
moribund in that attitude.  It is vital, timely
righteousness.  Mrs. Stuart must have set this
double reason before you."
</p>

<p>
Gordon remembered that she had.  In his agitation
during their final interview, believing that
she was laboring under a neurotic delusion, he had
given little heed to her argument.  Now, as a
lawyer, he perceived the ingenuity of the plea, though
he still regarded her as the victim of clerical
sophistry.  Yet he made no immediate response, and
Mr. Prentiss took advantage of the opportunity
to elucidate the situation.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Perry, you are led away by the special
merits of your own case.  I acknowledge the
hardship; I grant the pathos of the circumstances.
They present the strongest instance which could
be cited in justification of remarriage by a divorced
person.  But there must be more or less innocent
victims on the altar of every great principle.  The
Lord has demanded this service of His handmaid,
and, though her heart is wrung, she rejoices
in it."
</p>

<p>
"I see," said Gordon, "and that presents the
real issue.  Why should the Church usurp the
functions of the State?  Why in this age of the
world should it decide what is best for the human
race in a temporal matter, and substitute an arbitrary
and inflexible ethical standard of its own for
the judgment of organized society?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Prentiss's nostrils dilated from the
intensity of his kindled zeal.  "Why?  For two
reasons.  First, because the Church declines to regard
as a temporal matter an abuse which threatens the
existence of the family, the corner-stone of
Christian civilization; and second, because the State has
flagrantly neglected its duty, allowing divorce to
run riot through the nation without uniform
system or decent limitations.  Is the Church to
remain tongue-tied when the stability of the holy
bond of matrimony has become dependent on the
mere whims of either party?"
</p>

<p>
"I see the force of your position.  I will answer
you categorically.  As to the first reason, it seems
to me untenable.  As to the second, you accused
me just now of seeing only my side.  Let me
retaliate, and at the same time suggest that, though
you may seem to have a strong case, you do not
know the real facts."  Gordon, having reached a
more dispassionate stage of the argument, remembered
his cigar, which he proceeded to relight.  But
the rector, not accustomed to such colloquial dissent,
threw his own in the fireplace and crossed his arms.
</p>

<p>
"Regarding your first plea in behalf of the
Church's interference that the Church does not
look on marriage as a temporal concern, let me
remind you," continued Gordon, "that marriage
is the only matter in the realm of human social
affairs where the Church undertakes to nullify by
positive ordinance the law of the State&mdash;where
there is divided authority.  In all other social
affairs the law of the State is paramount.  The
Church forbids abstract vices&mdash;malice, uncharitableness,
lust, selfishness, intemperance, but it does
not attempt to define these in terms of human conduct,
or to substitute canons for the secular statute
book."
</p>

<p>
"The Church regards marriage as a sacrament."
</p>

<p>
"The Roman Catholic and the Episcopal.  If
I may say so, the attitude of both these churches
is a foreign influence."
</p>

<p>
The clergyman drew himself up.  "Foreign?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, foreign to native American ideas, and I
might add foreign to the claims of the first
followers of Christianity, for the early Christian
Church did not assert the right to perform the
marriage ceremony, or to regulate marriage.  Its
protectorate dates from a later period.  But what
I had in mind was that it is antagonistic to the
spirit both of our forefathers and their
descendants.  In the early days of New England the
service of marriage was performed not by the
minister, but by the magistrate, and marriages by
clergymen were forbidden.  It was the authority
of the State, the commonwealth, the considered
judgment of the community which was recognized."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Prentiss nodded.  "You are a Unitarian,
I judge."
</p>

<p>
"I was brought up in the Unitarian faith.  Like
most American men, I believe in the power of the
individual to work out his own salvation."
</p>

<p>
"But what message have you for a world of
sinners?" asked the rector, trenchantly.
</p>

<p>
"I appreciate the force of your criticism.  I am
conscious that the weakness of Unitarianism&mdash;of
individual liberty of conscience&mdash;is its coldness,
that it does not constantly hold out to the degenerate
soul the lure of a new spiritual birth.  It is
for this reason largely that your Church and the
Catholic Church have gained fresh converts in this
country and this city.  Moreover, those churches
have promoted among us picturesqueness, color,
and sentiment.  But, on the other hand, their
spirit is autocratic if not aristocratic, and in their
love for the pomp of the ages, in their fealty to
the so-called vested rights of civilization, they have
little sympathy with the rational, every-day
reasoning of republican democracy."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Prentiss pursed his lips.  There was no
offence in the speaker's manner or tone which
would justify a rebuke; on the contrary, they both
suggested that he was trying to speak dispassionately.
But the conclusions stirred the rector's
blood, and he tightened his folded arms.
</p>

<p>
"You seem to forget that the spirit of Christian
philanthropy, of the loving brotherhood of
man, is the controlling emotional force in the
Episcopal&mdash;yes, in the Roman Church to-day.  You
yourself are familiar, for example, with the work
of my Mr. Starkworth in the Church of the Redeemer."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  But neither Church has compassion on
the misery of common humanity when to relieve it
would conflict with the hard and fast letter of
church law.  That is where&mdash;and notably in this
matter of recognizing divorce&mdash;the other Protestant
churches, the Presbyterian, the Methodist and
the Baptist, have been more tolerant.  They have
refused to insist that it is for the benefit of
mankind that, under all circumstances, men and women
unhappily married should remain in durance vile
without the possibility of escape, or, having
escaped, should be condemned by precept to celibacy
for the rest of their lives.  And these are sects
whose creed is based on the essential sinfulness of
human nature."
</p>

<p>
The rector glowered at Gordon for a moment
from under his brows.  "Then where will you
draw the line?"  This was Mr. Prentiss's trump
card.  It expressed his utter weariness with what
he regarded as the foul system of conflicting and
irresponsible legislation, unceasingly and
scandalously availed of.
</p>

<p>
"That brings us to your second proposition!"
exclaimed Gordon.  "As to whether the State is
faithless to its duty.  Have you a copy of the
public laws, Mr. Prentiss?"
</p>

<p>
"Assuredly."  The rector strode across the
room and taking down two large volumes from the
book-shelf presented them to his visitor.  It
gratified him to demonstrate by this practical test the
broadness of his humanity.
</p>

<p>
"Do you happen to know the causes for which
divorce is granted in this State?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Prentiss hesitated.  Evidently he had no
exact information on the subject, which at this
juncture was disconcerting.  "For far too many
causes; I am sure of that," he replied, stoutly.
</p>

<p>
"I will read them to you.  'Impotence; adultery;
desertion for three years; sentence for felony
for two years; confirmed habits of intoxication;
extreme cruelty; grossly and wantonly refusing to
support wife.'"
</p>

<p>
The rector listened alertly, hoping to be able
to pounce on some conspicuously insufficient
provision.  Since this did not appear he made a
sweeping assertion.  "They are all inadequate in
my opinion except unfaithfulness to the marriage
vow, and I often doubt the wisdom of making an
exception there.  I am by no means sure that the
Roman Church is not right in its refusal to admit
the validity of divorce for any cause whatever."
</p>

<p>
"But what has been the course of history since
the Roman Church promulgated its canon at the
Council of Trent more than three hundred years
ago?  The cause of common sense and justice as
represented by the State has, in spite of the fierce
opposition of the clergy, won victory after victory,
until the institution of marriage has been placed
under the control of the secular law on most of the
Continent of Europe, and the right to divorce and
the right to remarry widely recognized&mdash;for instance
in France, Germany, Switzerland, Norway,
Denmark.  In France it's a criminal offence for a
priest to perform the religious ceremony of
marriage until after the civil ceremony."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and it was France which during the days
of the revolution permitted divorce at the mere
option of either party.  And there are signs that
we are rapidly imitating that same barbaric laxity
in the United States, and in this community."
</p>

<p>
"And if it were, would it be so much more
barbarous a condition than the conservatism of the
English law of Church and State, which grants
divorce to the man whose wife has been guilty of
adultery, but withholds it from a woman unless
her husband has been guilty of cruel and abusive
treatment into the bargain?"
</p>

<p>
The rector was touched on another sensitive
point.  He put out the palm of his hand.  "I fail
to see the relevancy of your comparison,
Mr. Perry.  However, the American Episcopal Church
is not responsible for the flaws in the details of the
English establishment.  The two are harmonious
and their aims are identical, but we do not follow
blindly."
</p>

<p>
"Yet the American Episcopal Church follows
its English parent and the Roman Catholic in
maintaining that the woman whose husband is an
inveterate drunkard, is convicted of murder or
embezzlement, kicks and beats her shamefully, or
deserts her utterly in cold blood, is guilty of a
crime against heaven and against society if she
breaks the bond and marries again.  Progressive
democracy in the person of the State is more
lenient, more merciful.  It refuses to believe that one
relentless, arbitrary rule is adapted to the
exigencies of human society.  It insists that each case
should be judged on its merits, and both relief
afforded and fresh happiness permitted when
justice so demands.  Think of the many poor
creatures in the lower ranks condemned by your
inexorable doctrine to miserable, lonely lives, who
might otherwise be happy!"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Prentiss's brow contracted as though he
were a little troubled by the appeal to his sympathy
with the toiling mass.  "One wearies of this
ever-lasting demand for happiness in this life," he
murmured.  "Was Christ happy?  They are free to
disregard the authority of the Church if they see
fit," he added.  "I for one should not feel justified
in refusing the communion to a divorced woman
who had remarried."
</p>

<p>
"But the Catholic Church would and does
uniformly; and the high church party in your own
church would disapprove of your leniency.  The
vital point is that both churches and you yourself
brand those who disobey as spiritually impure, or
at least inferior, a stigma which appalls the best
women.  And so they are held as in a cruel vice,
so you have held her who was to be my wife."
</p>

<p>
The reversion to the personal equation reminded
the rector that this was no academic discussion.
</p>

<p>
"You have not answered my question yet.
Where will you draw the line?  Granting for the
moment&mdash;which I by no means agree to&mdash;that
gross habits of intoxication, felony, or absolute
desertion are valid grounds for breaking the
nuptial bond, let me cite the law to you in turn,
Mr. Perry."  Thereupon Mr. Prentiss stepped to the
shelves again, and running through the pages of
a book, discovered presently the data of which he
was in search.  "What do you think of these
reasons?" he asked in a scorching tone.  "American
grounds of divorce: 'When it shall be made to
appear, to the satisfaction and conviction of the
court, that the parties cannot live in peace and
union together, and that their welfare requires
a separation,' Utah; 'Voluntarily living separate
for one year,' Wisconsin; 'For any cause that
permanently destroys the happiness of the petitioner
and defeats the purposes of the marriage relation,'
Connecticut; 'For any cause in the discretion of the
court,' Kentucky; 'Whenever the judge who hears
the cause decrees the case to be within the reason
of the law, within the general mischief the law
intended to remedy, or within what it may be
presumed would have been provided against by the
legislature establishing the foregoing cause of
divorce, had it foreseen the specific case and found
language to meet it without including cases not
within the same reason, he shall grant the divorce,'
Arizona; and in a host of States, 'One year's
absence without reasonable cause.'"
</p>

<p>
"I told you that you seemed to have a good
case," said Gordon, smiling.  "But I do not think
that you understand the facts, understand the real
nature of the abuse, for I heartily agree that an
abuse exists even from the standpoint of those who
maintain that divorce should be granted on the
slenderest grounds.  As to the extracts which you
have just read, I judge that the book is not a
recent publication."
</p>

<p>
"I have reason to believe that it is authoritative."
</p>

<p>
"Undoubtedly it was so at the time.  But several
of the provisions in question have been repealed
and are no longer law."
</p>

<p>
"Ah," said the rector.  "But you cannot deny
that it is still the law that a man and woman may
be married in one jurisdiction and adjudged guilty
of adultery or bigamy in another; that the
marriage tie is broken daily on the most frivolous
grounds and with the most indecent haste; and
that there is wide and revolting discrepancy
between the statutes of the several United States."
</p>

<p>
Gordon nodded.  "I cannot deny the substantial
accuracy of the indictment."
</p>

<p>
"Well, sir, how do you justify it?  Is not civil
society neglecting its duty?"
</p>

<p>
"I do not justify the defects in some of the legal
machinery, and to this extent I agree that society
is derelict.  But what I wish to make clear is that
nearly all the legal grounds for divorce in the
several states are just and reasonable&mdash;substantially
the same as in this State&mdash;and that the
abuses against which they afford relief are such
as render the relation of husband and wife
intolerable.  There are a few vague and lax
exceptions such as you have cited, but they are fast
disappearing.  The real and the salient evil lies
in the looseness of administration sanctioned in
some jurisdictions, by means of which collusive
divorces are obtained by pretended residents, and
close scrutiny of the facts is avoided by the
courts.  To permit legal domicile to be acquired
by a residence of three months, as in Dakota, is a
flagrant invitation to fraud; but that and kindred
abuses are defects in the police power, and have
only a collateral bearing on the main issue between
us, which is whether democracy can ever be induced
to reconsider its decision that it is for the
best interests of human nature that the innocent
wife or husband, to whom a cruel wrong has been
done, should be free to break the bond and marry
again.  There is the real question, Mr. Prentiss.
You as a churchman&mdash;a foreign churchman I still
claim&mdash;demand that the woman whose life has
been blighted by a husband's brutality, sentenced
for heinous crime, abandonment, or degrading
abuse of liquor should remain his wife to the end,
though he has killed every spark of love in her
soul.  The Church will never be able to convince
the American people or modern democracy that
this is spiritual or just."
</p>

<p>
"And yet a man who has been prohibited by the
courts of New York from marrying again has
merely to step into New Jersey and his marriage
there will be recognized and upheld by the courts
of New York.  But that you will probably describe
as another instance of defect in the police
power.  The line which you draw is evidently that
which any particular body of people&mdash;sovereign
states I believe they call them&mdash;sees fit to
establish.  The logical outcome of such a theory can
only be social chaos.  The sanctity of the home
is fundamentally imperilled thereby."
</p>

<p>
"And yet," said Gordon, "the family life of the
American people compares favorably with that of
any nation in affection, morality, and happiness.
More than three-fourths of the applicants for
divorce in the United States are women.  They have
thrown off the yoke of docile suffering which the
convention of the centuries has fastened upon
them."
</p>

<p>
"Some of them," interposed the rector with
spirited incisiveness.  "The shallow, the self-indulgent,
the indelicate, the earthly minded.  There
are many who are still true to the behests of the
spirit," he added significantly.  It was doubtless
an agreeable reflection to him that the one woman
in the world for his antagonist was among the
faithful.
</p>

<p>
"On the contrary, I believe that their number
is made up largely of the intelligent, the earnest,
and the vitally endowed.  Democracy maintains
that it is no worse for children to be educated
where love or legal freedom exists than where
there is thinly concealed hate, contempt, or
indifference."
</p>

<p>
It was obvious that neither had been or would
be convinced by the other's argument.  Probably
each had been well aware of this from the first.
Gordon had come warm with what he regarded
as the unwarranted injustice of the clergyman's
successful interference, unable to credit the belief
that it would not be withdrawn when the case was
coolly laid before him.  On his part Mr. Prentiss
had listened indulgently, certain of the deep-rooted
quality of his convictions, but willing to hear the
opposite side stated by a trained antagonist.  He
had been glad of an opportunity to elucidate the
Church's attitude, and had not been without hopes
of making cogent to this censor of different faith
the civilizing righteousness of the ecclesiastical
stand, or at any rate&mdash;which would be in the line
of progress&mdash;the demoralizing insufficiency of the
current secular reasons for divorce.  Apparently
he had failed in both, and moreover had encountered
a disposition toward obnoxious radicalism
which was disturbing.
</p>

<p>
"Then I am to presume that you, and so far
as you are at liberty to speak for them, the
American people" (Mr. Prentiss could be subtly biting
when the occasion demanded), "sanction practically
indiscriminate divorce?"
</p>

<p>
Gordon disregarded the sarcastic note.  The
bare question itself was sufficiently interesting.
</p>

<p>
"It is true, as you suggested just now, that the
American people have gone further in that direction
than any other except the French.  In France,
after the latitude of optional divorce palled,
divorce was abolished and was never authorized
again, as you may remember, until very recently&mdash;1884.
In the exuberance of our enthusiasm for
personal liberty the legislators in some of our
states&mdash;especially those of the most recent origin,
have shown an inclination to pass laws which
justify your conclusion.  But there is at present a
reaction.  The people have become disgusted with
the licentious shuffling on and off of the marriage
tie by the profligate element of the fashionable
rich through temporary residence and collusive
proceedings in other states.  You and I have a
recent flagrant instance in this city in mind.  Every
good citizen abhors such behavior, Mr. Prentiss.
But the public conscience has become aroused, and
steps are being taken to reform what I termed
the defects in the police power, partly by amendment
of the loose provisions by some of the offending
states, and partly by provisions in other states,
challenging the jurisdictional validity of foreign
divorces granted to their own citizens on paltry
grounds.  It is a misfortune that a national divorce
law is only among the remote possibilities.  And
yet, can there be any doubt that any uniform law
which the American people would consent to adopt
would necessarily include every one of the grounds
already law in this State, and which the Church
labels as inadequate?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Prentiss twisted in his chair.  "If the
Church were satisfied that the State was sincere,
a reasonable compromise might not be impossible.
Some of our thoughtful clergy have been feeling
their way toward this."
</p>

<p>
Gordon shook his head.  "But even your Church
would yield so little; and the Roman Catholic
nothing at all.  Would you consent to divorce for
gross drunkenness or conviction for felony?"
</p>

<p>
"If so, what becomes of the spiritual obligation
that one takes the other for better or for worse?
Shall a woman desert her husband in misery?  Is
long-suffering devotion to become antiquated?"
</p>

<p>
"As an obligation, yes.  If she loves him still,
she will cling to him.  But if their natures are
totally at variance, if she has been cruelly wronged
and disappointed by his conduct, she should have
the right to leave him and to wed again.  The
world of men and women has ceased to believe
that individual happiness should be sacrificed until
death to the cruel or degenerate vices of another."
</p>

<p>
"The doctrine of selfish individualism," murmured
the rector.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Stuart informed me that you made that
cry the basis of your objection.  I agree with you
that individualism has in many directions been
given too free scope, and that modern social
science is right in demanding that it should be
curbed for the common good.  But only when it
is for the common good, Mr. Prentiss.  Divorce
and remarriage are in many instances necessary
for the welfare of humanity, for the protection
and relief of the suffering and virtuous and the
joyous refreshment of maimed, tired lives."
</p>

<p>
"And how liable they are to become tired with
such easy avenues of escape!" Mr. Prentiss
hastened to exclaim.  "So long as remarriage is
stigmatized as a lapse from spiritual grace, young
couples will be patient and long-suffering.  The
truest love is often the fruit of mutual forbearance
during the early years of wedlock.  It is only
one step from what you demand to divorce for
general incompatibility.  I have yet to hear you
disclaim belief that this would be for the common
good, Mr. Perry."  Mr. Prentiss rolled out the
phrase "general incompatibility" with fierce gusto,
as though he were scornfully revelling in its felicity
as an epitome of his opponent's theory carried
to its logical conclusion.  He had been sparring
for wind, waiting for an opening as it were, and
feeling that he had found it, he forced the fighting.
</p>

<p>
"It is difficult to forecast what is to be the future
evolution of the divorce problem," answered Gordon,
reflectively.  "On one side is the security of
the home, as you have indicated, on the other the
claims of justice and happiness.  Just now respectable
society stands a little aghast&mdash;and no wonder&mdash;at
the scandalous lack of reverence for the marriage
tie shown by our new plutocracy&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Godless people!" interjected the rector.
</p>

<p>
"And will doubtless mend its fences for the
time being so as to refuse divorce except for
genuine tangible wrongs, such as those we have
discussed.  But if you ask me whether I believe that
in the end general incompatibility&mdash;meaning
thereby total lack of sympathy between husband and
wife&mdash;will be recognized by human society as a
valid and beneficial ground, my answer is that the
social drift is that way.  It will depend on the
attitude of the women.  They constitute by far the
majority of the applicants for divorce, as you
know.  If they become convinced that it will not
be for the welfare and happiness of themselves
and their children to remain tied to men utterly
uncongenial, the State probably will give them
their liberty.  But one thing is certain," he added,
"the Church will never be able to fasten again
upon the world its arbitrary standard."
</p>

<p>
Gordon rose as he finished.  He felt that the
interview was at an end, a drawn battle so far as
change of opinion was concerned.  But he had
chosen to complete his bird's-eye glimpse of the
possible future with a definite and pointed prediction.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Prentiss had listened with astonishment to
the speculative suggestion.  He had expected a
disavowal of the license embodied in his taunt, and
a floundering attempt at limitation which he hoped
would involve his adversary in an intellectual
quicksand.  Up to this point he had fancied
Gordon, though he had disagreed with him.  But now,
as he also rose, he manifested a shade of haughtiness,
as though he were dismissing someone who
had come perilously near landing himself outside
the pale of the respect which one man owes
another of the same class.  Ignoring the assertion
as to the decay of the Church's power, he said:
</p>

<p>
"Such an evolution as you predict, sir, would
undermine the structure of human society."
</p>

<p>
"It would be more or less revolutionary,
certainly," answered Gordon, blandly.  The
possibility seemed not to have proper terrors for him,
which was puzzling to the clergyman, who was
loth to regard this well-appearing young man as
a sympathizer with radical social doctrines.  He
stared at Gordon a moment.
</p>

<p>
"So long as women are as pure and spiritual
minded as Mrs. Stuart the laxity which you seem
to invite will be out of the question."
</p>

<p>
Here was an unequivocal reminder to Gordon
of the real fruitlessness of his interview.  It was
in effect a challenge; and he accepted it as such.
</p>

<p>
"She will yet become my wife."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Prentiss shook his head.  "I have known
her longer than you," he asserted proudly.
</p>

<p>
For a moment there was silence.  Issue had
been joined in these two sentences, and further
speech was superfluous.  It was Gordon who
relieved the tension, which seemed almost hostile,
by putting out his hand.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Prentiss," he said, "we disagree utterly,
but that is no reason surely why we should not part
with amicable respect for each other's differences
of opinion?  I know you are actuated solely by
the desire to accomplish what you believe to be
right."
</p>

<p>
The manly appeal was instantly reciprocated.
The clergyman grasped the outstretched hand and
shook it firmly.  To agree to disagree gracefully
was in keeping with his theories as to the proper
attitude of men of affairs.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Perry," he said, "I am glad to have made
your acquaintance.  Believe me, I grieve that the
church in my person must stand between you and
happiness.  If any matter at any time arises where
you think I could be of public service, do not
hesitate to consult me.  I am well aware that we
both are laborers in the same vineyard."
</p>

<p>
Considering that their theological views were
nearly as divergent as the poles, and that they
were battling for a woman's soul, this was
eminently conciliatory and rational on either side.

<p>
The parting with Gordon had been exceedingly
painful for Constance, but she had
not wavered.  The circumstance that they were
in the street had been a serviceable protection, for
it forced upon the interview a restraint which must
have been lacking had they been indoors.  She
was enabled to keep her lover at bay, and to meet
his protestations of devotion and dismay with the
answer that she had made up her mind.  At the
outset she had explained to him in a few words
that she had become convinced that marriage
would be inconsistent with her highest spiritual
duty and hence must be renounced.  Her responses
to his arguments and impetuous questions were
brief and substantially a repetition of her plea
that it was incumbent on them for the good of
civilization to stifle their love.  He did most of
the talking, she listened, and under the influence
of her resolution rebuffed him gently from time
to time, trying to make plain to him that
separation was inevitable.  When they had reached
Lincoln Chambers she felt it advisable for both their
sakes that he should not enter, but that they should
part with as little excitement as possible.  Of what
avail an emotional scene such as would be sure to
take place were she to let him in?  So she had
bidden him good-by then and there, informing him
that she was to become Mrs. Wilson's secretary.
She had permitted herself finally one last hand
clasp and the luxury of saying, "May God bless
you, Gordon.  You have been the truest friend
a woman ever had.  I wish you might be more.
Good-by."  Then she had fled, leaving him standing
aghast and still refusing to believe that she
could be in earnest.
</p>

<p>
After she was alone she was free to weep, and
weep she did, divining, perhaps, that the surest
way to drown her grief was to let sorrow have
sway for the moment.  When she faced life on the
morrow, quiet and resolute, she could not help
thinking of the Catholic Sisters of Charity whom
she was in the habit of seeing on the street, whose
faces so constantly suggested that they had
dispensed with earthly happiness.  But her elastic
nature demanded that she should seek earthly
happiness still, and she found herself protesting
against the thought that her renunciation might
sadden the remainder of her life.  Was not her
sacrifice for the welfare of society?  If so, it
behooved her to behold in it a real blessing over
which she should rejoice.  If it were not a cause
for congratulation, a real escape from evil, she
was simply worshipping a fetich as Gordon had
declared.  It was no case of preference for
spiritual over mundane things, but of a choice of what
was best for her as a human being.  Hence she
ought to find fresh zest in life itself, not wait for
future rewards.
</p>

<p>
So she sought to deaden her senses to every
thought or memory of Gordon, and to take up her
new life as a quickening privilege.  The first thing
to do was to regain the complete use of her eyes,
and for this patient idleness during several months
would be necessary.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, without demur, she lived up to her
promise to Mrs. Wilson by accepting the funds
necessary for her support until such time as she should
be able to assume the full duties of her position.
Mrs. Wilson made this easier for her by sending
her to investigate diverse philanthropic and
sociological appeals and employing her on a variety of
errands.  The present secretary had agreed to
remain until Constance could take her place, and was
glad to delegate such duties as the latter could
perform.  Accordingly Constance reported daily
for instructions and had the run of the office
appropriated to the secretary's use, a pretty room
furnished with a convenient but artistic desk, a
typewriter and all the paraphernalia for the
despatch of a large correspondence.  She longed
for the day to arrive when this room would be
hers, and she could devote herself unreservedly
to the furtherance of Mrs. Wilson's wide interests.
</p>

<p>
One evening, some fortnight after the parting
between Constance and Gordon, Loretta came
bouncing into Constance's apartment.  She had
been employed in one place as a nurse during that
period, but had completed her engagement the day
before.  She appeared to be in good spirits, and
Constance noticed that she had on a new hat and
jacket more gaudy than was her custom, as
though she had spent her earnings promptly and
freely.  Moreover she looked knowing.  The
cause of this last manifestation was disclosed
when, after a few preliminary greetings, she exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
"And so you've left Gordon Perry, Esq.,
Counsellor-at-Law!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  It wouldn't have been fair to Mr. Perry
to ask him to wait.  Besides, Mrs. Wilson has
invited me to become her private secretary.  Miss
Perkins is going to be married."
</p>

<p>
Loretta cocked her head on one side and winked
an eye.  She appeared amused by this plausible
explanation, which apparently was not news to her.
</p>

<p>
"I guess somebody else is going to be married
too."
</p>

<p>
Constance felt uncomfortable; she scented
mischief.  But there was nothing to do but look
innocent.
</p>

<p>
"A little bird told me to-day that you had only
to nod your head to become Mrs. Gordon Perry,
Esq."  Enjoying the look of confusion which this
bold sally evoked, Loretta approached Constance
and peered mockingly into her face.
</p>

<p>
"It's so, isn't it?  You're engaged and you can't
deny it.  I knew it!"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing of the kind, Loretta," she managed
to articulate with decision.
</p>

<p>
The little bird was evidently Mrs. Harrity.  But
the charwoman's gossip could only have been
conjecture, and of course her inquisitor knew nothing
definite.
</p>

<p>
"Well, it's your own fault if it isn't.  From
what I hear he's just crazy to get you."  Loretta
paused a moment; she was ferreting for information.
She seized Constance by the shoulders
and fixed her again with her shrewd gaze.  "You
can't fool me, Constance Stuart.  There's something
in the wind.  I shan't rest until I find out."
</p>

<p>
Constance noticed that her cheeks were slightly
flushed, and her eyes unnaturally bright.  Could
she have been drinking?  Surely not, or her breath
would have betrayed her.  Doubtless it was only
the excitement of deviltry awakened by feminine
curiosity.  Then it occurred to Constance to tell
her.  Was it not best to tell her?  Loretta would
make her life miserable, so she had intimated, if
she concealed the truth.  And then again, as she
was sacrificing her love for a principle, why conceal
from this other struggler the vital conclusion she
had reached?  It might help, or at least stimulate
Loretta.  She shrank from disclosing her precious
secret, but now that she was interrogated, was it
not the simplest, the most straightforward course
to confess what had happened and explain her
reason?
</p>

<p>
"Sit down, Loretta, and I will tell you."
</p>

<p>
The girl obeyed, surveying her with an exultant
mien.  Constance hesitated a moment.  It was not
easy to begin.  "Mr. Perry and I have talked
things over.  Yes, Loretta, he did ask me to marry
him."
</p>

<p>
Loretta uttered what resembled a whoop of
triumph, partly to celebrate her own perspicacity,
partly by way of congratulation.  "I felt sure of
it.  I knew he loved you by the way he was carrying on."
</p>

<p>
"And I loved him, but I'm not going to marry
him.  We are to see no more of each other for the
present.  It would be wrong for me to become his
wife."
</p>

<p>
Loretta stared as though she could not believe
her ears.  "Wrong?  Who says so?  You don't
mean to tell me you've refused him?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Constance a little sadly, for the
genuineness of the surprise expressed recalled her
own perplexity in discerning an adequate reason
for the sacrifice.
</p>

<p>
Loretta gasped.  "Well, you are a fool, and no
mistake!  Refuse a man like that who's crazy to
marry you and whom you love!  Wrong?  What's
wrong about it?"
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-400"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-400.jpg" alt="&quot;Refuse a man like that who's crazy to marry you!&quot;" />
<br />
&quot;Refuse a man like that who's crazy to marry you!&quot;
</p>

<p>
"It's contrary to the law of my church, which
forbids a woman who has a husband living from
marrying again."
</p>

<p>
"But he's as good as dead so far as you're
concerned," interjected Loretta.
</p>

<p>
Without heeding this pertinent remark Constance
proceeded to state the so-called spiritual
objections with succinct fervor.  She felt the desire
to reiterate aloud their complete potency.
</p>

<p>
Loretta listened closely, but with obvious
bewilderment and disdain.  Even now she seemed
unable to credit her companion's announcement as
genuine.
</p>

<p>
"If your clergyman won't marry you, get a
justice of the peace.  That's just as good."
</p>

<p>
Constance shook her head.  "From my point
of view remarriage would be sinful&mdash;impure."
</p>

<p>
Loretta leaned back on the lounge where she
was sitting and clasped her hands behind her head.
She appeared to be at a loss to find words to
express her feelings.
</p>

<p>
"And you mean to tell me that you've let that
man go&mdash;the man you love and who'd give you
a fine home and be a fond husband to you&mdash;for
such a reason as that?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," answered Constance, stanchly.
</p>

<p>
"Then all I can say is you didn't deserve such
luck.  He's too good for you."
</p>

<p>
Loretta's conviction went so deep that she had
become grave, and, so to speak, dignified in her
language.
</p>

<p>
"He's too good for any woman I know," Constance
felt impelled to assert.  "But for both our
sakes, all the same, it was my duty not to marry
him.  Mr. Perry knows my reasons and&mdash;and
respects them."
</p>

<p>
Constance had wondered many times what her
lover's present emotions were, but she chose to
take no less than this for granted.
</p>

<p>
"If he loves you as much as I guess he does,
he must just hate you, Constance Stuart.  My!
Think of throwing up a chance like that."  Then
suddenly a thought occurred to Loretta, and
leaning forward she asked tensely, "Does <i>she</i>
know?"
</p>

<p>
The suggestion of resentment on Gordon's part
had been to Constance like a dash of scalding
water.  The question just put served as a restorative.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Wilson?  It was she who advised me to
let him go.  She agrees with me entirely."
</p>

<p>
Loretta looked astonished and disappointed;
then she frowned.
</p>

<p>
"Just because you've been married once?  Not
if you got a divorce?"
</p>

<p>
"Never, so long as my husband is alive and we
are liable to meet in the flesh."
</p>

<p>
Constance realized that her phraseology had a
clerical sound; still she felt that she had a right to
the entire arsenal of the church.
</p>

<p>
"And she believes that too, does she?  Believes
that it would be wicked for a good looking,
hard-working girl, whose husband had left her in the
lurch, and may be dead for all she knows or cares,
to get a divorce and marry again?  And that's
the Church?  My! but it's the crankiest thing I
ever heard.  That's the sort of thing which sets
the common folk who use their wits against
religion.  There's no sense in it.  She's a widow;
would she refuse to marry again if the right man
came along?"
</p>

<p>
"That's different," said Constance, perceiving
that an answer was expected.
</p>

<p>
"And what's the difference?  It's all right to
be spliced to another man in three months after
the breath is out of the first one's body, as some of
them do, but impure to marry again so long as
the husband who has dragged you round by the
hair of your head is liable to drop in.  If it comes
to that, and marriages are made in heaven, as the
clergy say, what do the dead husbands and wives
think about second marriages anyway?  I'd be
real jealous if I were dead."
</p>

<p>
"The Church has thought it all out and come
to the conclusion that it is the best rule for human
society."
</p>

<p>
Constance spoke with hurried emphasis, hoping
to terminate the discussion.  She did not desire
to argue the matter with Loretta; at the same time
she recognized the familiar pertinency of the
allusions to dead husbands and wives.
</p>

<p>
Loretta detected Constance's nervous agitation.
"I hate to think it of her," she cried with sudden
illumination, "but I believe she has badgered you
into it!"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing of the kind, Loretta.  It's my own
free choice.  Mrs. Wilson simply made clear to
me the Church's side."
</p>

<p>
Loretta sneered.  "It's downright cruel, that's
what I call it.  The Church's side!  The Church
doesn't recognize divorce, but there's always been
ways for the rich&mdash;the folk with pull, kings and
such&mdash;to get the marriages they were tired of
pronounced void from the beginning.  It was only
necessary to show that they had been god-parents
to the same child, or were twenty-fifth cousins by
affinity, as it's called, or some such tomfoolery.
It didn't take Napoleon long when he wished to
get rid of Josephine to induce the Catholic Church
to declare that they never had been married,
though it was a good church wedding before a
cardinal.  Pshaw!  The Church has fooled the
people long enough.  What we want is justice and
common sense."
</p>

<p>
That same cry for justice, that same appeal to
common sense; and from what very different lips!
Yet though Constance shrank from the coarseness
of the exposition, somehow the naked saliency of
the argument was more persuasive than Gordon's
subtler plea.  Her instinctive compassion for the
masses asserted itself.  The fact that Loretta
should have touched at once the crucial point which
Gordon's trained intelligence had emphasized
struck her forcibly.  And after all, what was she
herself but one of the common people?  But she
said:
</p>

<p>
"The scandal in Mrs. Wilson's own family has
been the greatest grief and mortification to her."
</p>

<p>
Loretta bridled.  "Yes, and when Mrs. Waldo
gets her divorce in South Dakota and comes back
married again, won't everybody she cares about
receive her just the same?  In six months she'll be
staying in Benham and her mother'll be inviting
all the other multi-millionaires to meet her at a
big blow-out; see if she don't."  She paused, and
her eyes took on a crafty look.  "What do you
suppose she'd say if I were to go back to my man?"
</p>

<p>
Constance sat bolt upright from apprehension.
Loretta's air of mystery, which was accentuated
by a whispering tone, conveyed to her the true
import of the intimation.  Yet she would not seem
to understand.
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean, Loretta?"
</p>

<p>
"My man; the father of my child.  He was in
town the other day.  He has found out where I
am and has been plaguing me to go back to him."
</p>

<p>
"Did he ask you to marry him?" asked Constance,
seeking that solution.
</p>

<p>
"That's not what he meant.  But I've thought of
that too&mdash;on baby's account.  I guess he would if
I were set on it.  But we're both doing well single,
and&mdash;"  She stopped and laughed sarcastically&mdash;"and
supposing we didn't like each other and got
divorced, I could never marry anyone else."
</p>

<p>
"No matter about that now, Loretta.  Do you
love him still?"
</p>

<p>
"It's love that makes the world go round.
There isn't much else worth living for, I guess."  She
pursed her lips after this enigmatical answer,
then suddenly relaxed them in an impetuous
outburst.  "One thing's sure, Constance Stuart, you
don't know what love is or you'd never have sent
away Gordon Perry, Esq., Counsellor-at-Law."
</p>

<p>
"Don't, Loretta," said Constance, imploringly.
</p>

<p>
"It's true."
</p>

<p>
"I love him with all my heart.  You don't
understand."
</p>

<p>
"Pish!  If you'd loved him as a woman loves
a man when she does love him, you'd have been
married before this.  Why, there's times when I
feel like going right back to my man, and I'm
not what you'd call more than moderately fond
of him.  If it hadn't been that I didn't want to
disappoint her&mdash;and you&mdash;I'd have done it before
this.  Now the next time he comes back, I
shouldn't wonder if I did."  She leaned back again
on the sofa with her hands behind her head
nodding doggedly, and nursing her intention.
</p>

<p>
Constance, appalled, went over and sat down
beside her.  "Oh, but you mustn't, you mustn't!
Go to-morrow to see Mrs. Wilson and talk with
her.  She will give you strength and convince you
that unless you marry him such a course would be
suicide, a cruel wrong to yourself, dear&mdash;you who
have done so well."
</p>

<p>
"I've kept straight chiefly to suit her; but I
don't like what she has done to you."
</p>

<p>
"Please leave me and my affairs out of the question,
Loretta.  They have nothing to do with your
preserving your own self-respect."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know about that.  If she's just like
the rest; if that's a sample of the religion and the
beauty she prides herself on, I've been fooled,
you've been fooled.  What's the use of being
respectable if, when true love does come, a poor,
deserted woman is robbed of it for such a reason
as that?"
</p>

<p>
It surprised Constance that Loretta should take
sides so strongly, and she perceived that the girl
must have a tenderer feeling for her than she had
supposed.  This made her all the more anxious to
protect her.
</p>

<p>
"I value your sympathy very much, dear, but
it won't help me&mdash;it'll only make me dreadfully
unhappy if you do wrong."
</p>

<p>
Loretta looked at her keenly.  Then she took
out a small phial, similar to that which Constance
had observed on another occasion, and swallowed
a pellet ostentatiously.
</p>

<p>
"If you are troubled with the blues these are
the things to take.  They brace one splendid."
</p>

<p>
"What are they, Loretta?"
</p>

<p>
"If you promise to take some right along, I'll
tell you."  But she evidently was not eager to
disclose her secret, for she promptly replaced the
phial in her pocket and said, "I'll make a bargain
with you, Constance.  If you'll marry Gordon
Perry, Esq., Counsellor-at-Law, I'll keep straight."
</p>

<p>
Constance flushed.  "But I can't, dear.  It's all
settled."
</p>

<p>
"He will come back if you only whistle.  You
know that."
</p>

<p>
Constance let her eyes fall.  She feared that it
was too true.  But she could not afford to be
pensive.  She must be both resolute and resourceful,
for the future of this erring sister seemed to be
hanging in the balance.
</p>

<p>
"I can never marry Mr. Perry, Loretta.  But&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I thought better things of you, Constance.
Oh! well then I'll go back to my man."
</p>

<p>
"If you should do such a thing it would break
Mrs. Wilson's heart."
</p>

<p>
This seemed to Constance in her perplexity the
most hopeful appeal, and she was right, for
Loretta was obviously impressed by the remark.
</p>

<p>
"Would it?" she asked.  She looked down at
her large hands and let them rise and fall in her
lap like one nervously touched by sentiment.
</p>

<p>
"I do not know of anything which would
distress her more," continued Constance.
</p>

<p>
After a moment Loretta said, "He's away now.
He won't be on this route again for another four
months.  So there isn't any danger just yet."  She
shrugged her shoulders.  Then she rose, adding,
"I guess I'll go to bed," which was plainly
an intimation that this was to be the limit of her
present concession.
</p>

<p>
Constance was relieved, not only that immediate
danger was averted, but that the tie which bound
Loretta to Mrs. Wilson, however temporarily
strained, was still strong and compelling.  She
rejoiced to think that they were warned, so that
they could now keep a closer watch and leave
nothing undone to save her from further
degeneration.  She dismissed the subject by making
some inquiries in regard to Loretta's last case.
The girl's responses were to the point and brisk,
but she did not resume her seat, and evidently had
no intention of remaining.  Presently she got as
far as the door, where she stood discussing for a
few moments with her hand on the knob.  When
at last she opened it and was in the act of departing,
she turned her head and uttered this parting
shot, which indicated what was still uppermost in
her thoughts:
</p>

<p>
"I guess that you never really loved Gordon
Perry, Esq., Counsellor-at-Law, or you couldn't
have done it."
</p>

<p>
This taunt lingered in Constance's mind, though
she denied the impeachment to herself.  Was it not
indeed true, as Loretta said, that it is love which
makes the world go round?  Only for the sake
of righteousness was she justified as a healthy,
breathing woman in stifling this instinct.  If
Loretta in the future were to marry some one other than
the father of her child both the Church and
Mrs. Wilson would rejoice because the mere ceremony
of marriage had been lacking in the first relation;
yet she herself was forbidden to marry the man
she loved because she was tied to a faithless
husband by the mere husk of marriage.
</p>

<p>
She saw Loretta but two or three times before
her convalescence was complete and she had
assumed her duties as Mrs. Wilson's secretary, for
Loretta was sent for again shortly, and was only
at home in the interval between her engagements.
But Constance gave Mrs. Wilson forthwith an
inkling of Loretta's state of mind, though she
tried to believe that the girl's wanton threat was
a mere passing ebullition due to resentment of her
reason for refusing Gordon.  Nevertheless she did
not altogether like the expression of her eyes; it
suggested excitement, and predominance of that
boldness which, though typical, had been much in
abeyance during the period of her regeneration.
She remembered, too, the bottle of pellets, which
indicated that she was taking some drug.  So,
though she could not believe that she was seriously
considering such an abhorrent proceeding, she felt
it her duty to put Mrs. Wilson on her guard.
They both agreed, however, that the culprit must
be handled gingerly and not too much made
of the occurrence.  Accordingly Mrs. Wilson
straightway wrote to Loretta, but her letter was a
missive of interest and encouragement, not of
reproach or alarm.  She deplored in it that she had
lately seen but little of her ward, owing to the
latter's popularity as a nurse, and urged her to
call on her at the first opportunity.  She sent her
also one or two pretty toilet articles for herself
and some new frocks for her baby.  Constance
said nothing, however, to Mrs. Wilson as to
Loretta's attitude toward the church regarding
remarriage after divorce, for she could not bear
to renew the subject with her patroness.  It was
settled forever, and her spirit craved peace.

<h3>
XXIV
</h3>

<p>
It was a great relief to Constance when at last
she was once more self-supporting.  Her
eyes appeared to be as strong as ever, and she
found her new work congenial and absorbing.
She was not merely Mrs. Wilson's stenographer,
but her factotum, expected to exercise a general
superintendence over her employer's philanthropic
and social concerns, to attend to details, and,
through tactful personal interviews, to act as a
domestic buffer.  The change from the practical
severity of a law office, with its dusty shelves of
volumes uniformly bound in sheep, its plain
furniture and heterogeneous clientage, to her present
surroundings was both stimulating and startling.
Stimulating because it catered to her yearning for
contact with æsthetic influences to have the run of
this superb house and to be brought into daily
familiar association with all sorts of lavish
expenditure in aid of beautiful effects and beneficent
purposes.  Startling because the true quality of the
luxury aimed at was unknown to her until she
became a constant eye-witness.  In both Mrs. Wilson's
and her brother Carleton Howard's establishments
a major-domo presided over the purely domestic
relations, engaging the numerous servants,
and endeavoring to maintain such a competent
staff below stairs as to ensure delicious,
superabundant food and neat, noiseless service which
should emulate as far as possible the automatic
impersonality of male and female graven images.
All the appointments of the house were captivating;
the pantry closets bristled with beautiful
cut glass and delicate, superbly decorated china;
flowers in great profusion and variety were
brought three times a week from Carleton Howard's
private nurseries to be tastefully arranged by
a maid whose special duty it was to attend to this
and to see that those not needed for the decoration
of the house should be sent to the destinations
indicated by Mrs. Wilson through her secretary&mdash;hospitals,
friends in affliction or with birthdays,
and the like.  The spacious bathrooms were lined
with artistic tiles; electric lights had been adjusted
in the chambers so as to provide perfect facilities
for reading in bed; once a week an attendant called
to wind all the clocks in the house.  Mrs. Wilson's
personal appetite was not keen, yet exacting.  Her
breakfast was served in her own room, and, unless
she had company, her other meals were apt to be
slight in substance, but were invariably of a
delicate, distinguished character as regards
appearance if not ingredients.  Her steward had
instructions that the dinner table should be garnished
with flowers and the most luscious specimens of
the fruits of the season, though she were alone.
When she had guests these effects were amplified,
and her mind was constantly on the alert to provide
novelty for her entertainments.  During the first
season of Constance's employment, music between
the courses&mdash;a harpist, a quartette of violinists,
an orchestra&mdash;happened to be the favorite special
feature of her dinner parties.
</p>

<p>
That first winter Mrs. Wilson had the influenza
and went to Florida for a month for recuperation,
carrying her secretary with her.  The journey
was made in Mr. Howard's private car, and the
suite which they occupied at the elaborate modern
hotel where they stopped was the most select to
be obtained.  The spectacle at this winter resort
for restless multi-millionaires was another
bewildering experience for Constance.  The display
of toilets and diamonds at night in the vast ornate
dining-room was dazzling and almost grotesque
in its competitive features.  Mrs. Wilson
preserved her distinction by a rich simplicity of
costume.  She had left her most striking gowns at
home, and she let Constance perceive that her
sensibilities took umbrage at this public cockatoo
emulation of wealth.  She was even conspicuously
simple in regard to her food, as though she wished
to shun unmistakably being confounded with the
conglomeration of socially aspiring patrons, whose
antics jarred on her conceptions of beauty.  But
Constance could not avoid the reflection that
profuse, if not prodigal, expenditure was typical of
her companion no less than of them, and that the
distinction was simply one of taste.  What
impressed her was that so many people in the land
had merely to sign a check to command what they
desired, and that the mania for novel and special
comforts, and unique or gorgeous possessions was
in the air.  On their way home Mrs. Wilson spent
a few days in New York shopping, having directed
Constance to communicate in advance with several
dealers whose business it was to dispose of artistic
masterpieces.  She bought two pictures at a cost
of twenty-five thousand dollars apiece, an antique
collar of pearls, and several minor treasures.  At
the same time she took advantage of the occasion
to grant an interview to two persons, a man and
a woman, who had solicited her aid in behalf of
separate educational charities.  To each of these
enterprises, after proper consideration, she sent her
subscription for five thousand dollars.
</p>

<p>
Undoubtedly the chief purpose of Mrs. Wilson's
stay in New York was to see her daughter.
After a three months' residence in South Dakota,
Lucille had obtained a divorce on the ground of
cruelty, and had promptly married her admirer,
Bradbury Nicholson, son of the president of the
Chemical Trust.  Mrs. Wilson had declined to
attend the wedding, which took place in Sioux City
three days after the final decree had been entered&mdash;a
very quiet affair.  Lucille had notified her mother
that it was to occur, but was not surprised that
she did not take the journey.  She and her
husband had spent four months in Europe to let
people get accustomed to the idea that she was no
longer Mrs. Clarence Waldo, and recently they
had taken up their residence in New York.  Her
new husband had three millions of his own, and,
as Lucille complacently expressed the situation to
her mother, society had received them exactly as
if nothing had happened.
</p>

<p>
"I told you how it would be, Mamma," she
said.  "Everybody understands that Clarence and
I were mismated.  I am radiantly happy, and, as
for your granddaughter, she could not be fonder
of Bradbury if he were her own father.  He has
bought a thousand dollar pony for her.  All the
Nicholson connection and my old friends have
been giving us dinners, which shows that we can't
be disapproved of very strongly."
</p>

<p>
Lucille certainly looked in the best spirits when
she came to see her mother.  She was exquisitely
dressed, and her equipage, which stood at the
door during her visit, was in the height of fastidious
fashion.  So far as externals were concerned,
it was manifest that she was making good her
promise to be more conservative and decorous.
Mrs. Wilson saw fit to mark her abhorrence of
her daughter's course by going to a hotel instead
of to Lucille's large house on Fifth Avenue.  She
was not willing to stay under her new son-in-law's
roof, but how could she avoid making his
acquaintance and dining with him?  A definite
breach with her only child was out of the question,
as she had previously realized; besides her
grand-daughter demanded now more than ever her
oversight and affection.  Consequently on the second
day she dined at the new establishment, and
consented later to attend a dinner party which was
given in her honor, though Lucille kept that
compliment from her mother's knowledge until the
evening arrived.  She had taken pains to secure the
most socially distinguished and interesting people
of her acquaintance, and the affair was alluded to
in the newspapers as one of the most brilliant
festivities of the winter.  A leopard cannot
altogether change its spots, and Lucille's ruling
passion was still horses, but she desired to show her
mother that she had genuinely improved; so it
happened that after the guests had returned to the
drawing-room an organ-grinder accompanied by a
pleasing black-eyed young woman, both in fresh,
picturesque Italian attire, were ushered in.  They
proved to be no less than two high-priced artists
from the grand opera, who, after a few preliminary
capers to keep up the illusion, sang thrilling
duets and solos.  When they had finished came an
additional surprise in that the organ was shown
to be partially hollow and to contain a collection
of enamelled bonbonières which were passed on
trays by the servants among the delighted guests.
After the company had gone mother and daughter
had an intimate talk, in the course of which
Lucille, though making no apologies, volunteered the
statement that she in common with half a dozen
other women of her acquaintance had decided to
go into retirement in one of the church sisterhoods
during the period of Lent.  She explained that
the sisters of her new husband, who had high
church sympathies, were preparing to do the same
and that the project appealed to her.  Mrs. Wilson
was electrified.  It was on her lips to ask
Lucille how she could reconcile this new departure
with her hasty second marriage, but she shrank
from seeming to discourage what might be an
awakening of faith or even of æsthetic vitality in
her daughter's heart.  Still, though she rejoiced
in Lucille's apparent happiness and prosperity, she
felt stunned at the failure of Providence to
vindicate its own just workings.  Much as she desired
in the abstract that her daughter should be blessed,
how was it that so flagrant a violation of the
eternal proprieties could result not merely in
worldly advancement, but an attractive home?
For there was no denying that Bradbury
Nicholson was a far more engaging man than his
predecessor, and that he and Lucille were at present
highly sympathetic in their relations.  Would the
harmony last?  It ought not to, according to
spiritual reasoning.  And yet on the surface the dire
experiment had proved a success and there were
indications that permanent domestic joys and
stability were likely to be the outcome of what she
considered disgrace.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson did not condescend to refer to her
daughter's immediate past, but when she found
that Lucille was brimming over with fresh tidings
concerning the other offenders, Clarence Waldo and
Paul's wife, she suffered her to unbosom herself.
This news was consoling to her from the standpoint
of ethical justice.  As she already was aware,
Mrs. Paul Howard, obdurate in her impatience
of delay, had obtained a divorce on the ground of
cruelty in Nebraska after six months, the statutory
period necessary to acquire residence, and had then
married Clarence Waldo.  Now rumor reported
that the newly wedded couple, who had been
spending the present winter in Southern California
for the benefit of the second Mrs. Waldo's bronchial
tubes, had not hit it off well together, to
quote Lucille, and were likely to try again.  For
according to the stories of people just from Los
Angeles she was permitting a Congressman from
California, the owner of large silver mines, to
dance constant attendance on her, and her
husband, quite out of conceit of her to all
appearances, was solacing himself with a pretty widow
from Connecticut.
</p>

<p>
"Of course," added Lucille, contemplatively,
"if they really intend to obtain a divorce in order
to marry again, it will be convenient for them that
they happen to be in California, as that is another
of the states where one can acquire a legal
residence in six months."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson's disgust was tempered by a fierce
sense of triumph.  She was glad to know the facts,
but she did not wish to talk about them, especially
as she was far from clear in her mind that there
was any logical distinction to be drawn between
the conduct of these voluptuaries and that of her
own child.  She tossed her head as much as to
say that she desired to drop the unsavory topic.
But Lucille was so far blind to any similarity
between the cases, or else so far content with the
contrast in results between the two remarriages,
that she continued in the same vein, which was
pensive rather than critical.
</p>

<p>
"I am thankful that Paul insisted on keeping
Helen as a condition of not opposing his wife's
Nebraska libel, for it would have been rather
trying for the poor child to get used to three fathers
in less than three years."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson felt like choking.  The unpleasant
picture intensified her repulsion; yet she knew
that speech would be no relief for she would not
find Lucille properly sympathetic.  Just at that
moment her granddaughter came prancing into
the room, and ran to her.  Mrs. Wilson clasped
her to her breast as a mute outlet for her emotions,
for she could not help remembering that this child
also had two fathers, and what was the difference
but one of degree?  Yet here was its mother
smiling in her face, seemingly without qualms and
perfectly happy.  How was this peace of mind
to be reconciled with the eternal fitness of things?
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Lucille was saying, "Tell me about
Paul, Mamma.  How does he take it?  What is
he doing?"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson sighed.  "He was terribly cut up,
of course," she answered, gravely.  "He feels
keenly the family disgrace."  She paused
intentionally to let the words sink in.  "Fortunately
for him, he has been invited to run for Congress&mdash;that
is, if he can get the nomination.  It seems
there are several candidates, but your uncle tells
me Paul has the party organization behind him.
The caucuses for delegates do not meet until the
early autumn, and in the meantime he hopes to
make sufficient friends in the district, which
includes some of the small outlying country towns
as well as certain wards in Benham."
</p>

<p>
"It would be nice to have Paul at Washington,
for he might be able to get the duties taken off so
that our trunks wouldn't be examined when we
come from Europe.  I suppose it will cost him a
lot of money to be elected."
</p>

<p>
"I have not heard so," said her mother, stiffly.
Though Mrs. Wilson's statement was true,
certain allusions in her presence by Paul and his
father had aroused the suspicion in her mind that
elaborate plans to secure the necessary number of
delegates were already being laid.  The use of
money to carry elections was a public evil which
she heartily deplored, and which she was loth to
believe would be tolerated in her own family.
</p>

<p>
"He can afford it anyway," continued Lucille,
disregarding the disclaimer.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson changed the subject.  "He was also
much absorbed when I left in his new automobile."
</p>

<p>
Lucille clapped her hands.  "A red devil?"
</p>

<p>
"That name describes its appearance admirably.
It is the first one of the kind in Benham, and
naturally has excited much attention."
</p>

<p>
"Bradbury has promised me one for a birthday
present."
</p>

<p>
"I have not ridden with Paul yet," said Mrs. Wilson
a little wearily, for the enthusiasm elicited
appeared to her disproportionate to the theme.
"He has invited me once or twice, but somehow
the spirit has failed me."
</p>

<p>
Lucille gasped.  "It's the greatest fun on earth,
Mamma.  They annihilate time and distance, and
you feel with the rush and the wind in your face
as though you were queen of the earth.  If mine
runs well we intend to tour through the continent
this summer.  Fancy speeding from one capital of
Europe to another in a few hours!"  She paused,
then after a moment's reverie continued, as though
stating a really interesting sociological conclusion,
"I think it possible, Mamma, that if automobiles
had been invented earlier, Clarence and I might
not have bored each other.  Which wouldn't have
suited me at all," she added, "for Bradbury is a
thousand times nicer."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson was painfully conscious that Bradbury
was infinitely nicer, which increased the difficulties
in the way of replying to this incongruous
observation.  She decided to ignore it as essentially
flippant, and she rose to go.  It was the nearest
approach to a review of the past which either had
made during her stay in New York.
</p>

<p>
She hoped that Constance would not appreciate
how completely Lucille had rehabilitated herself
in a worldly sense, and she tried to counteract the
effect of the evidence by letting fall a remark now
and again to show that the memory of her daughter's
conduct was still a thorn in her side.  As a
mother she could not but be thankful that her
daughter was far happier as Mrs. Bradbury
Nicholson than she had been as Mrs. Clarence
Waldo.  At the same time her being so was a
blow to the theory that the exchange of one
husband for another ought to end and ordinarily does
end in misery; or, in other words, that divorced
people who marry again should be and are
apt to be unhappy.  To be sure, it was early to
judge, and the happiness might not last; and at
best it should be regarded as a sporadic case of
contradiction, a merciful exception to the general
rule; but she was glad when the day arrived for
removing Constance from the sphere of this
influence, fearing perhaps some pointed question
from her secretary which would invite her to
explain how it was that a person who had deserved
so little to be happy as Lucille should have found
divorce and remarriage a blessing, if the whole
proceeding in deserving cases was fundamentally
opposed to the social well-being of civilization.
As an antidote, Mrs. Wilson took pains to
enlighten her as to the rumored depravity of
Clarence Waldo and the late Mrs. Howard.
</p>

<p>
But Constance asked aloud no such question.
Yet necessarily she perceived that Lucille was in
the best of spirits, and apparently had suffered no
loss of position by her conduct.  Constance did
not need, however, any reminder from Mrs. Wilson
that the late Mrs. Waldo was not a person
of the finest sensibilities; moreover she considered
the point as definitely settled for herself.
Nevertheless as a spectator, if no more, she noted the
circumstance that Lucille was already a different
woman in consequence of her second marriage,
and she detected her reason challenging her
conscience with the inquiry which Mrs. Wilson had
dreaded, how it appeared that the world would
have been better off if Lucille had simply left the
husband who had been faithless to her, and
remained single instead of marrying.  Constance
was merely collecting evidence, as it were.  All
was over between her and Gordon, but as an
intelligent, sentient human being she had no intention
of playing the ostrich, but insisted on maintaining
an open mind.
</p>

<p>
It was now nearly a year since she had conversed
with Gordon.  Her sentence had been perpetual
banishment from his presence since the fateful
Sunday when they had parted.  He had written
to her that he could not bear to resume the old
relation, for now that they knew they had been
lovers in disguise, it could not be the old
relation.  He had declared that the best thing for
them both was never to meet, and she had been
forced to accept his decision, for he had not been
to see her since.  Yet he had mitigated the rigor
of her punishment, for she chose to regard it as
such, by occasional letters, written at irregular
intervals, letters which let her know beyond the
shadow of a doubt that the love he cherished for
her was strong and deep as ever.  He sent her
beautiful flowers on Christmas and her birthday,
and in writing to her he told her briefly whatever
of special interest he had been doing.  Precious
as these communications were to Constance, she
was of several minds as to whether to answer them.
Her impulse always was to reply at once, if only
that she might draw forth another letter; but
sometimes her scruples forced her not to let him
see how much she cared and to feign indifference
by silence.  She knew, as Loretta said, that she had
only to whistle and he would come to her, and she
felt that it would be cruel to give him the smallest
encouragement to believe that she could ever alter
her decision.  This being so, she argued that he
ought to marry; he must forget her and chose
someone else.  She tried to believe that she would
rejoice to hear that he was engaged to another
woman, but when her thoughts got running in this
channel she was apt to break down and realize
that she had been trying to deceive herself.  In such
moments of revulsion she now and then would
throw her scruples to the winds and write him
about herself and her doings.  On two occasions
she had suddenly decided that it was necessary for
her to see him again; see him without his seeing
her.  Consequently she had frequented a spot
down-town where she knew he would pass, and
each time had been rewarded by a close and
unobserved glimpse of his dear features.  These
glimpses, the letters, and the flowers were the
bright shining milestones along the itinerary of her
much occupied life.  Busy and interested as she
was in her employment, it sometimes seemed to
her that she walked in a trance in the intervals
between some word or sign from him.
</p>

<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-422.jpg" alt="The flowers were the bright, shining milestone." />
<br />
The flowers were the bright, shining milestone.
</p>

<p>
Delighted as she had been to travel, to see such
a diverse panorama of national life as her trip to
Florida and New York afforded, she was glad to
find herself again at home.  She had not heard
from Gordon during her absence, and she was
eager to see the Benham newspapers again in order
to ascertain what he had been doing in his new
capacity as a legislator.  He had written to her
the preceding autumn that he had decided to allow
the use of his name as a candidate for the State
Assembly, and subsequently he had been elected.
Before her departure in the early days of the
session, she had kept her eyes and ears on the alert
for public mention of him, but had been informed
that this was the period for committee conferences
and that the opportunity for debate would come
after the bills had been framed and were before
the house.  Constance knew that Gordon had the
strong support of the Citizens' Club in his canvass,
that Hall Collins, Ernest Bent and others affiliated
with that organization had conducted rallies in his
behalf, and that he was expected to favor progressive
legislation.  There were certain philanthropic
measures in which Mrs. Wilson was interested also
before the Assembly, and Constance had twice
already prepared letters from her employer to
Gordon in reference to these, which was another slight
opportunity for keeping in touch with him.
</p>

<p>
Shortly after Mrs. Wilson's return from her
vacation it happened that Paul invited her again
to ride in his automobile.  Recalling Lucille's
enthusiasm, and having been partial all her life to
new æsthetic sensations, she concluded to test
the exhilaration described by those who doted
on these machines.  The afternoon chosen was
one of those days in the early spring when sky
and wind combine to simulate the balminess of
summer.  It was a satisfaction for Paul to
have his aunt beside him both because he
admired her and because, seeing that he regarded
her as what he called a true sport at bottom, he
felt confident that she had only to experience the
sensation of speed to become an enthusiast like
himself.  Therefore, he let his red devil show
what it could do, in the hope of carrying her by
storm.  Equipped with suitable wraps and a pair
of goggles, Mrs. Wilson found the process of
whirling through the country at a breakneck pace,
by the mere compression of a lever, a weird and
rather magnetic ordeal.  These were the adjectives
which she employed to express her gratification
to her nephew.  She was glad to have tried
it, but in her secret soul she had grave doubts if
it were the sort of thing she liked.  Nevertheless
she did her best to appear delighted, for she had
in mind to drop a few words of warning in Paul's
ear to the effect that it was incumbent on men of
his class in the community to preserve their
self-respect in the matter of electioneering as an
example to the country at large.  In the intervals
when Paul moderated the speed she endeavored
to convey to him clearly but not too concretely the
substance of her solicitude.  She let him realize
that she had him and his campaign in mind, but
that she did not intend to meddle beyond the limit
of emphasizing a principle unless he were to ask
her advice.  Paul listened to what she had to say
with evident interest, and without interruption.
He even let his machine crawl along so as to get
the complete benefit of her exposition.  When she
had set forth her views she turned toward him
and said in conclusion, by way of showing that she
made no charges but simply desired to put him on
his guard:
</p>

<p>
"Very likely you have thought this all out for
yourself and intend to see that every dollar you
may use is expended legitimately."
</p>

<p>
Paul let the automobile come to a halt, and
removing his goggles proceeded to wipe off the
dust and moisture.
</p>

<p>
"Aunt Miriam, every word which you've said is
gospel truth; but&mdash;and it is a large but&mdash;if I were
to follow your advice to the letter there would
not be the slightest possibility of my securing the
nomination.  I've thought it all out, as you say,
and I'd give gladly to charity twice the sum I shall
be compelled to spend, if I could only confine my
outlay to legitimate expenses, stationery, printing
and the hiring of a few halls.  I've no objection
to explaining to you why I can't, provided I wish
to keep in the running.  There are three men
including myself in this district," he continued,
starting the lever, "who are bidding for the
nomination.  Each of us has a machine, a machine the
function of which is to create enthusiasm.  Ninety
per cent. of the candidates for public office do not
inspire enthusiasm; they have to manufacture it.
And there are all sorts of ways of doing so; by
paying club assessments and equipping torch-light
paraders with uniforms; by invading the homes of
horny-handed proletarians and sending tennis or
ping-pong sets to their progeny; or by the solider,
subtler method of large direct cash payments,
which can never be detected, to a certain number
of local vampires as expenses for influence, and
whose <i>quid pro quo</i> is the delivery of the goods
at the polls.  I have engaged a smooth and highly
recommended patriot at a high salary to conduct
my canvass.  He has told me there will be large
expenses.  When he asks for money I draw a check
and ask no questions&mdash;a rank coward's way I
admit.  I know nothing as to what he does with the
money, and so I salve my conscience after a
fashion."  Paul shrugged his shoulders and applied a
little more power to the automobile, while he
chanted:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Some naturalists observe the flea<br />
  Has smaller fleas on him to prey,<br />
  And these have smaller still to bite 'em,<br />
  And so proceed <i>ad infinitum</i>.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Which means, my dear aunt," he continued,
"that when a rich man runs for office a certain
proportion of the free-born consider that they are
entitled to direct or indirect pickings in return for
a vote."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson sighed.  "But is not the price too
high for a free-born citizen to pay?  Why
exchange private life and the herbs of personal
respect for publicity and a stalled ox which is
tainted?"
</p>

<p>
"I've thought occasionally of getting out, but
father would be disappointed.  I wish to go to
Congress myself and the party wishes me to go.
And what would be the result if I retired?  One
of the other two would win, and I don't throw any
large bouquet at myself in stating that I shall
make a much more useful and disinterested
Congressman than either of them."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson shook her head, but at the same
time she appreciated the difficulties of the
situation.  For she herself desired to see her nephew
go to Washington.  It was one thing to tell him
to take a brave stand and refuse to swerve from
the path of highest political probity, another to
advise him in the midst of the canvass to dismiss
his manager and thus invite certain defeat.  It
sometimes seemed to her that the ways of the
world of men were past understanding.  She
wondered whether, if human affairs were in the hands
of women, the rivalry of politics and the competition
of commercialism would tolerate the same
army of highwaymen who held up would-be decent
citizens as successfully and appallingly as Dick
Turpin and Claude Duval.  She liked to believe
that complete purity would reign, and yet the
memory of what some women to her knowledge were
capable of in the bitterness of club politics served
as a caveat to that deduction.  Discouraging as
Paul's observations were, as bearing on the ethical
progress of human nature, and deeply as she
deplored the fact that he appeared to be winking at
bribery, she recognized that she had shot her bolt,
for she was not sufficiently conversant with the
different grades of electioneering impropriety to
be willing to take on herself the responsibility of
imploring him to retire, even if he would consent
to do so.  But the confession had robbed the day
of much of its beauty for her.  She glanced at the
little clock in the dashboard, and remembering that
she desired to leave a message for her secretary,
to whom she had given an afternoon off, she asked
Paul if he would return home by way of Lincoln
Chambers.
</p>

<p>
It happened that in turning something went
wrong, so that the automobile came to a stop.
Paul was obliged to potter over the mechanism
a quarter of an hour before he was able to get
the better of the infirmity.  Somewhat nettled,
and eager to make up for lost time and to demonstrate
to his companion that in spite of this mishap
a red devil was the peer of all vehicles, he
forced the pace toward Benham.  By the time he
was within the city limits his blood was coursing
in his veins as the result of the impetus, and he
felt on his mettle to amaze the onlookers as he
sped swiftly and dexterously through the streets.
Gliding from avenue to avenue without misadventure
he applied a little extra power as they flew
down that street around one corner of which stood
Lincoln Chambers, in order to make an impressive
finish.  In turning he described an accurate but
short circle, so that the automobile careened
slightly, causing Mrs. Wilson to utter an involuntary
murmur.  Paul, amused at her nervousness, suffered
his attention to be diverted for an instant;
the next he realized that a young child, darting
from the sidewalk, was in the direct path of the
rapidly moving machine.  He strained every nerve
to prevent a collision, shutting off the power and
endeavoring to deflect the vehicle's course so that
it might strike the curbstone to their own peril
rather than the child's; but the catastrophe was
complete almost before he realized that it was
inevitable.  There was a sickening bump, accompanied
by the screams of women; the red devil had
overwhelmed and crushed the little victim, and
stood panting and shaking like a rudely curbed
dragon.
</p>

<p>
Paul jumped from his seat and lifted the child
from the gutter into which it had been hurled and
where it lay ominously still with its head against
the curbstone.  He found himself face to face with
two women, in one of whom he recognized his
aunt's secretary.  The other with an assertive
agony which made plain her right to interfere,
sought to take the child from him&mdash;a flaxen-haired
girl of about four&mdash;exclaiming:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, what have you done?  You've killed her.
You've killed her."
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Mrs. Wilson, utterly shocked,
sought to keep her head as the only possible
amelioration of the horror.  She whispered in
Paul's ear: "There's a drug store opposite.  We'll
take her there first and send for a doctor."  At
the same time she put her arm around the mother's
shoulder, and said, "Let him carry her, Loretta,
dear.  It is best so."
</p>

<p>
Loretta Davis desisted, though she stared wildly
in her patron's face.
</p>

<p>
"The blood&mdash;the blood," she cried, pointing to
the tell-tale streaks on the child's head.  "I'm sure
she's dead."
</p>

<p>
Acting on his aunt's suggestion, Paul bounded
across the way with the limp form clasped in his
arms.  While those immediately concerned
endeavored with the aid of the apothecary to
ascertain that the injuries were not grave, a curious
crowd began to gather in the store.  By the time
that the trial of the ordinary restoratives had
made clear that the child was already beyond the
aid of medicine, though Mrs. Wilson and Constance
wrung their hands and counted the seconds
in hope that the physician telephoned for would
arrive, a reporter, a policeman, and a doctor
appeared on the scene.  The physician, who
happened to be passing, was Dr. Dale, the oculist with
the closely cut beard and incisive manner who had
attended Constance.  A moment's inspection
sufficed him for a verdict.
</p>

<p>
"There is nothing to be done," he said.
</p>

<p>
At the fell words a wave of anguish passed
through the group.  Paul allowed Mrs. Wilson
to take the baby from him; and, overwhelmed
beyond the point of control, he bowed his head in
his hands, and burst into tears.  His aunt
reverently clasped the stiffening form to her bosom
regardless of the oozing blood which mottled her
cloak.
</p>

<p>
"We must get Loretta home as quickly as possible,"
she whispered to Constance, and she started
to lead the way so as to save the situation from
further publicity.
</p>

<p>
But now that the doctor's usefulness was at an
end, the two other representatives of social
authority advanced their claims for recognition.  The
police officer, having relegated the gaping spectators
to a respectful distance, began to inquire into
the circumstances of the accident, in which he was
ably surpassed by the agent of the press, who,
note-book in hand, had already been collecting
material from the bystanders and composing a
sketch of the surroundings before interviewing the
principals.  Paul gave his name and address, and
made no attempt to disguise his responsibility for
the tragedy.  Mrs. Wilson, finding her way barred
by the two functionaries, grudgingly gave similar
information in the hope that they would be
allowed to escape.  As she bore the victim in her
arms, this would have been the result had not
Loretta, who was following close behind under the
supervision of Constance, and who up to this point
had seemed dazed by the proceedings, suddenly
realized what was taking place.  She clutched
Constance's arm.
</p>

<p>
"Will it be in the newspapers?" she inquired
with feverish interest.
</p>

<p>
The reporter overheard her inquiry.  "You are
the mother of the little girl, madam?" he asked,
addressing her, pencil in hand.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  She is my only child."
</p>

<p>
"Your name is?"
</p>

<p>
"Loretta Davis."
</p>

<p>
"And the child's?"
</p>

<p>
"Tottie.  She would have been five in a few
weeks."
</p>

<p>
The reporter perceived that he had found a
responsive subject.  "I lost a little girl of just that
age two years ago," he volunteered sympathetically.
"Is there a photograph of Tottie which
you could let me have for the press?  The public
would like to see what she looked like."
</p>

<p>
Loretta's eyes sparkled.  She thrust her hand
in her pocket and drew forth a photographer's
envelope.  "Isn't it lucky," she cried, "I got these
proofs only yesterday, and they're the living image
of my baby."
</p>

<p>
As she hastily removed the package from her
pocket, together with her handkerchief, Loretta
let a small bottle slip to the floor.  Constance, who
was spellbound with dismay at the turn of affairs,
stooped mechanically to pick it up.  She recognized
the pellets lauded by Loretta.  In doing so
her head nearly bumped against that of Dr. Dale,
who was intent on a similar purpose.  He got
possession of the bottle, and instinctively he
glanced at the label before transferring it to
Constance.  She observed that he shrugged his shoulders.
As she put out her hand to take it from him,
she said in a low, resolute tone:
</p>

<p>
"Will you tell me what those are?"  Then as
the physician regarded her searchingly, she added,
"I have a special reason for asking.  I wish to
befriend her."
</p>

<p>
"Cocaine tablets," answered Dr. Dale.  "The
woman has the appearance of a drug habitué."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
XXV
</h3>

<p>
In parting with the Rev. Mr. Prentiss without
personal rancor and yet with an open avowal
of his conviction that Constance would marry him
in the end, Gordon Perry both made an admission
and issued a challenge.  His admission on the
surface was simply that he recognized the rector's
sincerity.  In his own consciousness it went further;
he recognized the validity of the conflict between
them to an extent which he had up to this time
failed to perceive, or at least to acknowledge.
</p>

<p>
The effect of this was to intensify the ardor of
his convictions, but at the same time to cause him
as a lawyer to respect his opponent's position,
though he believed it to be utterly false.  The
interview had been absorbing to him sociologically,
for it had crystallized in his own mind as concrete
realities certain drifts or tendencies of which he
had been aware, but which he had hitherto never
formulated in words.  Now that the occasion was
come for doing so, the indictment&mdash;for it was that&mdash;had
risen spontaneously to his lips.  It was clear
to him, as he had informed Mr. Prentiss, that
there was a direct strife in American social
evolution between those who sought eternal truth
through the free processes of the human spirit
and those who accepted it distilled through an
hierarchy.
</p>

<p>
Just as in his sociological perplexities Gordon,
yearning to be a sane spirit, had abstained from
radicalism and had sought relief in concrete
practical activities, he had watched the theological
firmament and had felt his way.  If he realized
that the Christian organizations which saw in the
human soul a dignity which rejected mediation
were merely holding their own as formal bodies,
he comforted himself with the knowledge that the
thousands of men and women who rarely entered
the churches&mdash;among them many of the most
thoughtful and busiest workers in the land&mdash;were
to a unit sympathizers with the creed of soul-freedom
and soul-development.  Not merely this; he
knew that among orthodox worshippers the secret
belief of the majority of the educated already
rejected as superfluous or antiquated most of the
old dogmas.  But with his reverence for religion
as an institution, Gordon had no ambition to
outstrip his generation; simply to be in the van of it.
There was no attraction for him in iconoclasm;
he craved illumination, yet not at the expense of
rationalism.  Now suddenly the practical issue of
the Church's interference with the State, of the
Church's imposition on mankind of a cruel, inflexible
ideal, labelled as superior purity, had become
both an immediate and a personal concern.  His
soul felt seared as by an iron; all his instincts of
sympathy with common humanity, the helpless
victims of an arbitrary aim to preserve the family
at the expense of the blameless individual, were
aroused and intensified.  Viewed as a general issue,
Gordon felt no question as to the outcome.  Was
it not already decided?  The Church had never
ceased to deplore as usurpation society's constantly
louder claim the world over of the right to
regulate marriage, but without avail.  It was only
abuse by the State which had produced a reaction
and given sacerdotalism another chance.  But the
particular, the personal issue, was a very different
matter.  For him it meant everything, and his
whole being revolted at the possibility of losing
the great joy of life through such a misapprehension
of spiritual duty on the part of her who, so
far as he was concerned, was the one woman in
existence.  Yet during the next weeks following
the interview with the clergyman he experienced
a sense of flatness which was almost despondency,
for he realized that he had exhausted his resources.
Mr. Prentiss had refused to aid him; on the
contrary, had virtually defied him by expressing a
triumphant conviction that Constance's decision
was final.  Could it be that she, whose lucidity of
mind he had been wont to admire, would refuse
to understand that the barrier which seemed to
separate them was but an illusion?  Surely it was
not for the good of the world that true love&mdash;its
most vital force&mdash;should be starved because the
marriage tie was played fast and loose with by
others.  And yet he appreciated apprehensively
the subtlety of this plea for the world's good; how
modern it was, and how attractive to woman when
made the motive for the exercise of renunciation.
Truly, the priest had argued shrewdly, yet Gordon
refused to admit that Constance could be deceived
for long.  That seemed too incompatible with her
previous outlook and their delightful comradeship
which had held love in disguise.
</p>

<p>
He concluded forthwith that his best hope lay
in terminating that comradeship.  To resume it
would make them brother and sister, a relation
tantalizing to him, and which might be better than
nothing to her, and thus strengthen her resolve.
Accordingly, with Spartan courage, he never visited
her.  But he chose by his letters and his gifts
to let her know unequivocally that he was waiting
for her to relent&mdash;would wait until the end of
time.  He wrote to her that her dear image was
the constant inspiration of his thoughts, and that
he sighed for the sound of her voice.
</p>

<p>
While thus he chafed within, and yet endeavored
to pursue his work as earnestly as though he
had been able to forget, he received and accepted
an invitation from the Citizens' Club to become
a candidate for the State Assembly.  He saw in
this both relief and an incentive; public service
would tend to divert and refresh his thoughts, and
opportunity would be afforded him to promote
legislation.  It would suit him to become a
member of the free parliament of men where, whatever
its abuses and shortcomings, the needs of ordinary
humanity were threshed out, and where true,
practical reforms were piece by piece won from
the vested traditions of the past.
</p>

<p>
At the same time he declared to the members
of the committee which waited on him that in
accepting their nomination he was not to be
understood as offering himself to the voters as a
denunciatory radical or as advocating all the so-called
grievances aired at the Citizens' Club.  His words
were, "I agree to support every measure which I
believe would be an immediate benefit to the
community from the standpoint of justice and public
usefulness.  If you are content with that guarded
generalization, I shall be proud to serve you; but
if you insist on my playing the demagogue or wearing
the livery of the enemies of constituted society,
I must decline the nomination."
</p>

<p>
"That's all right," asserted Hall Collins, who
was the spokesman.  "What we want this trip
are two or three new pieces of timber in the ship
of state, repairs we'll call them if you like it so,
and we've chosen you as carpenter for the job.
Side with us when you can, and when you can't
we'll know you're honest."
</p>

<p>
This voiced the sentiment of the Citizens' Club,
and it was no disparagement to the sincerity of its
action that those who directed the club's affairs
cherished hopes that the nominee, through his
standing, would gain support from other quarters
than the radical element and thus be more likely
to win.  Their hopes were justified.  Gordon had
a comfortable majority in his district, though it
was understood that he had affiliations with
so-called socialists and labor reformers.
</p>

<p>
During the first year of his service as a legislator
he made no effort to fix public attention on
himself by forensic readiness.  He was studying the
methods of procedure and familiarizing himself
with the personnel of the assembly.  But though
his name did not appear conspicuously in the press
notices&mdash;which was a disappointment to a certain
lady constantly on the watch for it&mdash;this did not
mean that he failed to attract the attention of his
associates.  On the contrary, his thoroughness,
patience, and fairness were soon recognized, and
when he rose to speak&mdash;which he did more
frequently in the later weeks of the session in relation
to bills of importance where the vote was likely to
be close&mdash;the members paid attention as though
they were glad to know his reasons.  It was
perceived that he inclined to the party of progress
rather than to the conservatives, but that he did
not hesitate to turn a cold shoulder towards or to
rebuke mere blatherskite or visionary measures.
</p>

<p>
A modern legislature has to deal with questions
which vitally affect the development of the body
politic; the relations of powerful corporations to
the public and it to them; the demands of toiling
bread-winners for shorter hours of labor and
hygienic safeguards, and the newly fermented
strife between the right to hold and the obligation
to share the fruits of the earth and the profits of
superior ability and industry.  These were problems
which particularly interested Gordon, and, as
one by one they arose for action, he sought to solve
each on its merits without prejudice and with an
eye to justice.  It was understood that he would
be a candidate for the next assembly, and in making
their forecast the sophisticated referred to him
as a coming leader, one of the men who would
control the balance of power by force of his
intelligence and independence.  The Citizens' Club was
content with the part which he had played.  Several
measures in which it was interested had become
law through his advocacy; others, though defeated,
had gained ground; two notable bills conferring
valuable franchises for next to nothing upon
plausible capitalists had been exposed and given
their quietus in spite of a persistent lobby; and the
candidate had promised during the next session to
press the bill for a progressive legacy tax, an
amendment to the existing legacy tax law, which
would increase the sum levied in progressive ratio
with the size of every estate transferred by death.
This was a reform which Hall Collins and his
intimates had at heart, and they had won Gordon to
their side as an enthusiastic supporter of its
essential reasonableness.  The bill had been killed in
committee for the past two years; yet the present
year the adverse report had been challenged in the
house and had been sustained by a comparatively
small majority after strenuous and excited appeals
to what was termed the sober, conservative sense
of the American people.  Gordon's speech in behalf
of the measure was listened to with a silence
which suggested a desire for enlightenment.  After
the debate was over there had been prophecies that
another year it would stand a good chance of
passing.
</p>

<p>
It was toward the close of Gordon's first session
in the assembly that the harrowing death of
Loretta's child occurred, and, owing to the prominence
of the parties concerned in the homicide, which
was the first automobile accident in Benham,
became town talk.  The newspaper artists illustrated
the tragedy with drawings of the red devil in the
act of striking the victim, portraits of everybody
concerned, from Tottie to the apothecary into
whose shop she had been carried, and camera cuts
of the obsequies.  There were appropriate
editorials on the iniquity of allowing furious engines
to be propelled at a rapid rate through the streets;
and sensational conflicting rumors were rife in the
news columns as to the amount by which the
repentant multi-millionaire had sought to idemnify
the mother for his carelessness.  Conjecture fixed it
at various sums from one thousand to fifty thousand
dollars, and one imaginative scribe conjured
up the information that Tottie was to be replaced
as far as possible by the most beautiful baby which
the Howard family could procure by search or
advertisement.
</p>

<p>
In his genuine distress for the irreparable evil
he had wrought Paul Howard had gone straightway
to Loretta to pour out his contrition and to
express a willingness to make such amends as were
possible for the catastrophe.  He saw her twice;
the first time on the day following the accident,
when she appeared excited but dazed; the second
on the morning after the funeral.  Then her condition
of mind bordered closely on exaltation as the
result of being the temporary focus of public
attention.  She was surrounded by newspapers, and
she insisted on calling Paul's notice to all the
reportorial features.  With special pride she made
him note a cut which showed that the coffin had
been piled high with the most exquisite flowers&mdash;a
joint contribution from Mrs. Wilson and himself.
Loretta's own apartment was also a bower of roses
from the same sympathizing source, and the young
woman was in her best dress-festal mourning&mdash;as
though she were expecting visitors.  Paul found
some difficulty in broaching the question of
indemnity.  He was in the mood to draw his check for
any sum in reason which the bereaved mother
should declare to be satisfactory compensation for
her loss even though it were excessive, so that he
might adjust the matter then and there.  He had
every intention of being generous; moreover he
knew that all this publicity concerning the accident
was injuring his canvass for the Congressional
nomination, and he hoped to create a reaction in
his favor by behaving handsomely.  But Loretta,
though she obviously understood what he was
driving at, evaded the topic, and when, in order
to clinch matters, he told her in plain terms that
he wished to make her a present and asked her to
name the sum, she looked knowing and suspicious,
as much as to say that she knew her rights and had
no intention of committing herself.
</p>

<p>
Paul, who mistook her contrariness for
diffidence, was on the point of naming an amount
which would have made her open her eyes when
she suddenly said with a leer intended to convey
the impression of shrewdness:
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to talk with my lawyer first.  People
say it was all your fault, and that I ought to
get a fortune.  I've witnesses for my side."
</p>

<p>
Paul was taken aback.  "It was all my fault.
I've told you already that I was entirely to blame.
And I'm anxious for you to tell me how much I
ought to pay as damages.  So there won't be any
need of a lawyer on either side."
</p>

<p>
Loretta argued to herself that she was not to
be caught by any such smooth words.  She tossed
her head.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know about that.  I'm going to get
one of the smartest attorneys in Benham to attend
to my case."  She waited a moment, then added
triumphantly, believing that her announcement
would carry dismay to her crafty visitor, "It's
Gordon Perry, Esq., Counsellor-at-Law."
</p>

<p>
"Gordon Perry?"
</p>

<p>
Loretta construed his inflection of astonishment
as consternation.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she said, "I'm going to consult him this
afternoon."
</p>

<p>
It was on Paul's lips to inform her that Gordon
was his lawyer too, but her uncompromising
attitude had produced its natural effect, and he felt
at liberty to practise a little craft in his turn.  If
he were to disclose the truth, she would be likely
to consult someone else; whereas Gordon and he
could come to terms speedily.  So he merely
responded that he knew Mr. Perry to be an excellent
attorney, and that he would be content to abide by
his decision.
</p>

<p>
The final settlement required some diplomacy
on Gordon's part on account of the difference in
point of view between the contracting parties.
Loretta had definitely fixed on ten thousand
dollars as the Mecca of her hopes, than which, as she
declared to Gordon at their first interview, she
would not accept a cent less; whereas Paul was
disposed to make her comfortable for life by a
donation of twenty-five thousand.  He naturally
had discussed the subject with his aunt, and this
was the sum which had been agreed on between
them as fitting.  Mrs. Wilson was overwhelmed
by the disaster; it haunted her thoughts; and,
though she remembered Loretta's original
indifference regarding the child, it seemed to her that
the only possible expiation would be a princely
benefaction, such as would thrill the bereaved
recipient.  But when she in her turn mentioned the
matter to Constance, the latter, who had been
mulling over the insinuation uttered by Dr. Dale,
informed her what he had said.  The effect of
this intelligence was to strengthen the purpose
which Mrs. Wilson and Paul had already formed
to have the gift tied up so that Loretta could use
only the income, and thus be protected indefinitely
against designing companions and herself.  But
when Gordon, who had abstained from revealing
the extent of Paul's intended liberality, suggested
this arrangement, he encountered sour opposition
from his client.  It was manifest that Loretta had
set her heart on being complete mistress of the ten
thousand dollars, and that any curtailment of her
power to exhibit it and spend it as she saw fit
would be a bitter disappointment.  Either she did
not understand, or declined to understand what
was meant by a trust, and plainly she regarded
the proposition as a subterfuge on the part of the
donor to keep his clutch on the money.  Gordon
endeavored to reason with her and to show her the
disinterested wisdom of the plan, but she shook
her head no less resolutely after he had finished.
When her repugnance was stated to Paul, he bade
Gordon pay her the ten thousand dollars in cash
and say nothing about the remainder.  He added
good-naturedly:
</p>

<p>
"I suppose it's natural enough that she should
like to finger the money.  Let her blow it in as she
chooses, and when it's gone I'll settle an annuity
on her."
</p>

<p>
Loretta came to Constance on the following
day with glittering eyes and exhibited her
treasure-trove&mdash;a bank book and a roll of bills.
</p>

<p>
"It's all there," she said.  "My lawyer went
with me and he saw me hand it all over except this
hundred dollars to the man in the cage.  My
lawyer made me count it first.  He's smart&mdash;Gordon
Perry, Esq., Counsellor-at-Law.  I'm rich now."
</p>

<p>
"But you will go on nursing just the same, won't
you, Loretta?  It's your profession, you know."
</p>

<p>
Loretta looked non-committal.  "Perhaps.  But
I'm going to take a rest first and&mdash;and buy a few
things."  She spread out proudly the new crisp
bank bills like a pack of cards.  "I've never been
able to buy anything before."
</p>

<p>
Solicitous as she felt regarding the future,
Constance had not the heart to repress sympathy with
this radiant mood.  Blood money as it was, it
would, nevertheless, mean many pleasures and
comforts to the pensioner.  It was no time for
advice or for extracting promises of good behavior.
So in a few words she showed the approach to
envy which was expected of her.
</p>

<p>
By way of recompense, or because she had been
waiting for congratulations to be paid first,
Loretta presently paused, looked knowing, and giving
Constance a nudge whispered oracularly, as one
whose views were now entitled to respectful
consideration, "I sounded him about you, Constance,
and it's all right.  I could see it is, though I guess he
didn't like much my speaking.  And what do you
suppose I told him?  That he mustn't get discouraged,
for one had only to look at you to know
that you were perfectly miserable without him."
</p>

<p>
"How dare you tell him such a thing?  What
right had you to meddle?" cried Constance,
beside herself with anger and humiliation.  She
clenched her hands; she wished that she might
throw herself upon this arch, complacent busybody
and box her ears.  "This is too much!  Besides,
it is not true&mdash;it is not true."
</p>

<p>
"True?  Of course it's true.  And why should
you mind its being true if you love him?  I was
trying to help you, Constance, so there's no use in
getting mad."
</p>

<p>
Obviously Loretta on her side was surprised
at the reception accorded her good offices, and at
a loss to explain such an abnormal outburst on the
part of her habitually gentle comrade.  Perception
of this swiftly checked the current of Constance's
wrath, but, as her equanimity returned, the
eyes of her mind became pitilessly fixed on
herself.  Perfectly miserable!  Was not that indeed
the real truth?  And true not only of her but of
him?  Of him, who had told her that she was
sacrificing the joy of both their lives to a fetich.
Loretta's rude probing had made one thing
clear&mdash;that it was futile to try longer to persuade
herself that she was happy.
</p>

<p>
Yet her reply was, "I take you at your word,
Loretta, that you meant no harm.  Please
remember, however, hereafter that my relations with
Mr. Perry are a subject not to be spoken of to
either of us, if you do not wish to be unkind."
</p>

<p>
Loretta stared, and laughed as though she
suspected that this appeal was designed to put her
off the scent.  But she was too much absorbed in
her own altered status to care to bandy words on
the matter.  Two days later she disappeared from
Lincoln Chambers.  But the fact of her absence
awakened no concern in the mind of Constance
for several weeks inasmuch as she had gathered
from Mrs. Harrity that Loretta had gone to another
patient.  But presently it transpired that she
had taken all her belongings with her, and had
made the charwoman promise to make no mention
of that mysterious fact for the time being.
Mrs. Harrity could throw no further light on the
lodger's exodus, but admitted that under the spell
of one of the crisp new bills she had asked no
questions and subsequently held her tongue.
</p>

<p>
Constance immediately imparted her fears to
Mrs. Wilson, who instituted promptly a search
through the police authorities.  Investigation
disclosed that a woman answering to the description
of Loretta had been seen at some of the restaurants
and entertainment resorts of flashy character
in the company of a man with whom there was
reason to believe she had left town.  It was found
also on inquiry at the bank where here funds had
been placed that the entire deposit had been
withdrawn some three weeks subsequent to the date
when the account was opened.
</p>

<p>
Confronted with this disagreeable intelligence
Mrs. Wilson felt aghast.  It occasioned her
grievous personal distress that her ward should
have fallen so signally from grace at the very
moment when the spirit of righteousness should have
triumphed, and she was displeased to think that
her philanthropic acumen had been at fault.  But
the elasticity of her spirit presently prevailed, and
it was with an exculpating sense of recovery and
of illumination which was almost breathless that
she said to Constance:
</p>

<p>
"I fear that we must face the fact that she is a
degenerate; one of those unhappy beings whom the
helping hands of society are powerless to uplift
because of their inherent preference for evil."
</p>

<p>
Upon her lips the word "degenerate" had the
sound of the ring of fate and of modern scientific
sophistication withal.

XXVI
</h3>

<p>
A year later, in the early days of spring and
the closing weeks of the next State Assembly,
Carlton Howard and his son Paul sat
conversing in Mrs. Wilson's study.  They had
been dining with her, and on rising from the table
she had invited them to keep her company in her
private apartment while she busied herself with
matters incident to the entertainment she was to
give in a little more than a week to the members
of the American Society for the Discussion of
Social Problems, as the crowning festivity to its four
days' meeting in Benham.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson was elated over the opportunity to
mingle the thoughtful people of the country&mdash;some
of whom, as seen at annual meetings of the
society elsewhere, appeared to her to have
cultivated intellectual aptness at the expense of the
graces of life&mdash;and Benham's fashionable coterie.
She reasoned that the experience would be
stimulating for both, and with her secretary at her
elbow she was absorbed in planning various
features to give distinction to the event.  Her
hospitality, from one point of view, would not be the
first of its kind in the annals of the society, for at
each of the last two meetings&mdash;the one in Chicago,
the other in St. Louis&mdash;there had been an attempt
to entertain the members more lavishly than
hitherto.  So in a sense she felt herself on her
mettle to set before her visitors the best which
Benham afforded, and so effectively as to eclipse
the past and at the same time bring a little nearer
that appropriate blending between beauty and
wisdom to which she looked forward as an ultimate
social aim.
</p>

<p>
She had been of many minds as to what form
her entertainment should take, and had finally
settled on this programme: Dinner was to be served
at her house to the seventy-five visiting and
resident members and a sprinkling of Benham's most
socially gifted spirits, at little tables holding six
or eight.  A reception was to follow, to which the
rest of her acquaintance was invited to meet the
investigators of social problems.  At this there
was to be a vaudeville performance by artists from
New York, after which, before supper, six of
Benham's prettiest and most fashionable girls were to
pass around, as keepsakes for the visitors, silver
ornaments reminiscent of Benham in their shape
or design.  Mrs. Wilson was not wholly satisfied
with this programme; she was conscious that it
lacked complete novelty and was not æsthetically
so convincing as some of her previous efforts; but
considering the numbers to be fed&mdash;and she was
determined that these thoughtful pilgrims should
taste delicious food faultlessly served for once in
their lives&mdash;she could think of no more subtle
form of hospitality which would give them the
opportunity to realize the artistic significance of
her establishment.
</p>

<p>
There were so many things to be attended to,
a portion of which occurred to her on the spur of
the moment, that Mrs. Wilson had requested her
secretary to make long working hours, and
occasionally, as on this day, to protract them through
the evening.  Constance was at her desk in the
room appropriated to her use, which led out of
Mrs. Wilson's study.  The door was open, and
where she sat it was easy to distinguish the
conversation which went on there.  When Mrs. Wilson
needed her she touched a silver bell far more
melodious in its tone that the squeak of electric
communication.  Constance had already exchanged
greetings with her employer's brother and nephew,
whose random dialogue, broken by the digestive
pauses which are apt to occur after a good dinner,
provided a cosey stimulus to Mrs. Wilson's
musings.  Mrs. Wilson enjoyed the feeling that
she was in the bosom of her family, and that, at
the same time, absorbed in her cogitations, she
need give no more than a careless ear to the talk
of railroad earnings and other purely masculine
concerns.  She was pleased too by the knowledge
that Lucille was coming in a few days to pay her
a visit, bringing her granddaughter and the new
Nicholson baby, a boy.  Her new son-in-law also
was coming, and she could not help feeling elated
at the prospect of letting Benham see that the
marriage which ought to have been a failure had
turned out surprisingly well, and that her
daughter was a reputable and somewhat elegant figure
in society&mdash;not exactly the woman she had meant
her to be, but immeasurably superior to what she
had at one time feared.  She was aware in her
heart that logically, according to her standards,
Lucille was not a person to be made much of
socially, and yet she intended her and her husband
to be a feature of her entertainment, and she felt
sure that her acquaintance would regard them as
such.  Though the inconsistency troubled her,
inducing, if she stopped to think, spiritual qualms,
maternal instinct jealously stifled reflection, and,
furthermore, pursuing its natural bent, was
rejoicing in the opportunity.  Once, when interrogated
sharply by conscience, in the watches of the
night, she had satisfied her intelligence by answering
back that her behavior was ostrich-like but
human.  Since the rest of her world failed to turn
a cold shoulder on Lucille, was it for her to
withhold the welcome befitting an only child?
</p>

<p>
Paul Howard was now a Congressman-elect.
His canvass for the nomination the previous
autumn had been successful, and the rumors in
circulation as to the sum which he had paid over to
his manager to accomplish this result by methods
more or less savoring of bribery, were still rife.
These had reached Paul's ears, and he was unable
to deny that the most sensational figures were far
in excess of the actual truth.  Concerning the rest
of the indictment, he could say literally that he
knew nothing definite.  He had drawn checks and
asked no questions.  But in his secret soul he had
no doubts as to its substantial accuracy, and after
the first flush of victory was over the edge of his
self-satisfaction had been dulled by regret at the
moral price which he had been obliged to pay in
order to become a Congressman.  Yet he had
comforted himself with the thought that otherwise he
could not have won the nomination, and that he
intended to become an exemplary and useful
member.  So by this time he had ceased to dwell
on the irretrievable and was enjoying the
consciousness that he was to go to Washington, where
he hoped to make his mark.  Who could tell?
With his means and popularity he might eventually
become a United States Senator, or secure
some desirable diplomatic appointment.
</p>

<p>
Paul had been spending a few days in New
York, and personal business matters formed at
first the topic of conversation between the two
men.  When presently the younger inquired if
anything of general interest had happened in
Benham during his absence, his father frowned and
said:
</p>

<p>
"That man Perry is pressing his socialistic
legacy tax bill."
</p>

<p>
Paul looked interested.  He understood the
allusion, for shortly previous to his departure for
New York, in consequence of his father's animadversions,
he had taken occasion to see Gordon and
to discuss the question with him.
</p>

<p>
"I object to the principle; it's an entering
wedge," continued Mr. Howard.  "When you say
that because I leave a larger estate than you, my
estate shall pay a larger proportionate tax than
yours, you confiscate property.  It is only another
step to make the ratio of increase such that after
a certain sum all will be appropriated by the
state.  It would be a blow at individual enterprise,
and so at the stability of the family.  If you
deprive men of the right to accumulate and to
leave to their children the full fruits of their
industry and brains, you take away the great
incentive to surmount obstacles and to excel."
</p>

<p>
The banker in broaching the subject had
uttered Gordon's name with denunciatory clearness,
so that Constance heard it distinctly.  Her
spirit rose in protest at the condemning tone, and
she paused in her occupation to listen.  As
Mr. Howard proceeded she recognized the character
of his grievance.  In the last letter Gordon had
written her, now more than a month previous, he
had mentioned the fact that he was interested in
the success of what he termed the progressive
legacy tax bill, and she had closely followed its
course in the legislature.  She knew that the
committee to which it was referred had reported in
its favor by a majority of one; she had also
gathered, from what she read in the newspapers, that
it was regarded as the most important public
measure of the session, and was to be hotly
debated.  While she sought to smother her personal
feelings, so that she might give due consideration
to Mr. Howard's argument, he paused, and Paul's
voice retorted:
</p>

<p>
"I mentioned the one hundred per cent. argument
to Gordon Perry, and he smiled at it.
He said that so unreasonable and oppressive an
extreme was out of the question, and a mere
bogy."
</p>

<p>
"Will he guarantee it?" demanded the banker
sternly.  "He cannot; he can answer only for the
legislative body of which he is a member.  If the
present bill passes, why may not an Assembly
twenty-five years hence declare that the public
good&mdash;meaning the necessary tax levy for the expenses
of an extravagant socialistic republic&mdash;demands
that all which any man dies possessed of in excess
of half a million dollars should, by the operation
of a sliding scale of percentage, be confiscated by
the State?"
</p>

<p>
"But on the other hand is it really unjust to
tax the estate of one, who dies possessed of a
fortune larger than is sufficient to satisfy every
craving of his heirs, considerably more in
proportion than that of the citizen of moderate means
whose children need every dollar?  That is what
Don Perry would answer.  Moreover, this bill is
tolerably easy on the children of the rich, is rather
more severe on brothers and sisters than on lineal
descendants, and so on through the family tree.
The people who inherit millions from a cousin are
scarcely to be pitied if the State steps in and takes
a respectable slice."
</p>

<p>
"To hear you talk one would imagine you were
a supporter of the measure," said his father
haughtily, recognizing Paul's proclivity to take the
opposite side of an argument, but evidently
regarding the subject as too serious for economic
philandering.
</p>

<p>
Paul laughed.  "I suppose I should vote against
it on general principles&mdash;meaning that it's best to
hold on to what one has as long as possible.  But
it's one of the sanest attempts to get at the surplus
accumulations of the prosperous for the benefit of
everybody else which has thus far been devised.
Indeed, we're not pioneers in this&mdash;in fact, rather
behind the times as a democratic nation.  It has
been introduced already with success, for instance,
in the republic of Switzerland, and in Australia
and New Zealand."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Howard made a gesture of impatience.
"Very likely.  The two last-named countries are
the hot-bed of socialistic experiments.  Will you
tell me," he added, with slow emphasis, "what
society is to gain by disintegrating large fortunes
acquired by energy and thrift?  I myself have
given away three million dollars for hospitals,
libraries, and educational endowments in the last
ten years.  Will the State make a better use of the
surplus, as you call it?"
</p>

<p>
"The trouble is, father, that some multi-millionaires
are less generous than you.  Evidently the
State is of the opinion that the returns would foot
up larger under a compulsory law than under the
present voluntary system."
</p>

<p>
"Up to this time personal individuality has been
the distinguishing trait of the American people.
I believe that the nation has too much sense to
sacrifice the rights of the individual to&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He paused, seeking the fit phrase to express his
meaning, and was glibly anticipated by Paul.
</p>

<p>
"To the envious demands of the mob.  That is
one way of putting it.  Gordon Perry's statement
would be that society has reached the point where
the so-called vested rights of the individual must
now and again be sacrificed on the altar of the
common good, and that a moderate bill like this
is the modern scientific method of rehabilitating
the meaning of the word justice."
</p>

<p>
Unable to see the disputants, but listening with
all her ears, Constance recognized the argument.
The common good!  Here was the same issue
between the individual on one side and the
community on the other; and this time Gordon was
the champion of the State against the individual.
Clearly he acknowledged the obligation&mdash;the
soundness of the principle provided that the
sacrifice would redound to the benefit of civilization.
Yet the same mind which demanded a progressive
legacy tax bill in the name of human justice
rejected an inflexible mandate against remarriage as
a cruel infringement on the rights of two souls as
against the world.  There could be only one
explanation of the inconsistency; namely, that he
believed profoundly that such a mandate was not
for the common good.  She knew this already, yet
somehow its presentation in this parallel form
struck her imagination.  While thus she mused
Constance heard Mr. Howard say in response to
Paul's last sally:
</p>

<p>
"I request that you will not entrust to that
young man any more of the firm's business.  I
prefer an attorney with less speculative ambitions."
</p>

<p>
Paul laughed again.  "As you will, father.
Gordon Perry has all the practice he can attend to
without ours.  He is hopelessly on his feet so far
as our disapproval&mdash;or even a boycott&mdash;is concerned."
</p>

<p>
"And his bill will not pass," said the banker,
with the concise assurance of one who knows
whereof he is speaking, and is conscious of reserve
power.  "I have sent for the chairman of our
State Committee."
</p>

<p>
"If the party is against it, you know I am a
good party man, father."
</p>

<p>
"It isn't a question of party.  It goes deeper
than that; it's fundamental.  I've arranged for a
conference&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
At this point Mr. Howard saw fit to lower his
voice.  It was evident to Constance that he was
imparting secrets, and revealing the machinations
by which he expected to defeat or side-track the
obnoxious measure.  If only she could hear and
warn Gordon!  But what they said was no longer
audible.  The men's talk had dropped to an
inarticulate murmur, which continued for a few
moments, and then was interrupted by Mrs. Wilson's
dulcet tones.  The change of key had attracted
her attention, which already in subconsciousness
had followed the thread of the dialogue, though
her deliberate thoughts were far away.
</p>

<p>
"I have been listening to you two people," she
said aloud, "and it is an interesting theme.  I
agree with you, my dear Paul, academically; as
an eventual sociological development the surplus
should be appropriated for the public good.  But
I wonder if we are quite ready for it yet.  In
other words, can the community&mdash;the State&mdash;the
mass be trusted to administer the revenues thus
acquired so as to produce more wholesome and
beneficent results for the general weal than are
now being fostered by the wealthy and enlightened
humanitarian few under the existing laws?
In the present stage of our civilization might not
the standards of efficiency be lowered by such a
policy, and the true development of art and beauty
be arrested?  There is my doubt."
</p>

<p>
Her brother's response had the ring of an
epigram.  "To the end of time, Miriam, human
affairs must be managed by the capable few, or the
many will suffer.  If you deprive able men of the
power of accumulation, the price of bread will
soon be dearer."
</p>

<p>
"And what the many hope for sooner or later
is free champagne," remarked Paul.
</p>

<p>
Neither of his elders replied to this quizzical
utterance, and there was a brief silence.  Then
Mrs. Wilson stepped to the doorway of the
anteroom and told Constance that she did not require
her services further that evening.  She had
suddenly remembered the former intimacy between
her secretary and the protagonist of the bill.
</p>

<p>
For the next week Constance diligently studied
the newspapers for information in regard to the
mooted measure.  The entire community seemed
suddenly aroused to the significance of the issue,
and the daily press teemed with reading matter in
relation thereto.  The debate on the occasion of
the second reading of the bill was the most
protracted and earnest of the session.  As Mr. Howard
had intimated, it was not strictly a party
measure; that is, it found advocates and opponents
among the members of each of the two great
political parties; only the so-called socialistic
contingent gave it undivided support.  But developments
soon revealed that nearly all the conservative,
eminently respectable members of the party to
which Mr. Carleton Howard belonged were lining
up in opposition to the bill on one plea or another.
It was denounced by some as dangerous, by others,
as unconstitutional; numerous amendments were
offered in order to kill it by exaggerating its
radical features or to render it innocuous.  Constance
imagined that she could discern the master hand
of the banker in the fluctuations of sentiment, in
some of the editorials, and in the solemn resolutions
of certain commercial bodies.
</p>

<p>
It was at the third reading of the bill that
Gordon made his great speech&mdash;great from the point
of view of the friends of the measure, because it
set forth without undue excitement and superfluous
oratory the essential soundness and justice
of their cause.  A packed house listened in
absorbed silence to the forceful, concise presentation.
On the morrow the rival merits of the controversy
were still more eagerly bruited throughout the
State.  Constance could restrain herself no longer.
Her lover was being stigmatized by the lips of
many as an enemy of established society, yet she
must not go to him and show her admiration and
her faith.  But she would write&mdash;just a line to
let him know that she understood what he was
attempting, and that she was on his side in the
struggle for the common good against individualism
and the pride of wealth.  By way of answer
there came next day merely a bunch of forget-me-nots
addressed to her in his handwriting.  She
pressed the dainty yet humble flowers to her lips,
then placed them in her breast.  They seemed to
express better than the pomp of roses his steadfast
allegiance to her and to humanity.
</p>

<p>
The days of the debate were those just preceding
the coming of the pilgrims belonging to the
Society for the Discussion of Social Problems.
Constance's most formal duties in connection
therewith had already been performed, but
Mrs. Wilson kept her constantly at hand lest new ideas
should occur to her or emergencies arise.  Besides
there were numerous minor details relating to the
august entertainment on the final evening which
demanded supervision.  Constance was very busy,
but in her heart the query was ever rising, Will
he win? She had learned that the bill had been
put over for three days, and that the vote on its
passage was to be taken on the date of Mrs. Wilson's
festivity, probably in the late afternoon, as
there was certain to be further discussion before
the roll was called.
</p>

<p>
The four days' exercises of the Society consisted
of the reading of papers on current national
problems, one series in the morning, another in
the evening, with opportunities for general
comment.  The afternoons were devoted to recreation
and the visiting of points of local interest, such
as the oil yards, pork factories, and other
commercial plants across the Nye to which Benham owed
its growth and vitality; to Wetmore College, the
Institution of learning for the higher education of
women; and to the new public library and Silas
S. Parsons free hospital.  Mrs. Wilson was an
absorbed and prominent figure at all the meetings.
She had no paper of her own to read, but on two
occasions she made a few remarks on the topic
before the Society when the moment for discussion
arrived.  On the third day, moreover, at the end
of the paper on "The Development of Art in the
United States," the president rose and made the
announcement of a gift of five hundred thousand
dollars from Mrs. Randolph Wilson and her
brother for the erection of a Free Art Museum for
Benham on the land already bonded by the city.
Constance had the satisfaction of hearing the
applause which greeted the declaration of this
splendid endowment.  Mrs. Wilson had made it
possible for her to attend several of the meetings as
educational opportunities, but she had received no
inkling of this interesting secret.
</p>

<p>
Late in the afternoon of the next day, that fixed
for the entertainment and for the ballot on
Gordon's bill, Constance was informed by the butler
that there was a woman below who desired to see
her.  The man's manner prompted her to make
some inquiry, and she learned that the visitor was
Loretta Davis; that she had asked first for
Mrs. Wilson, and on being told that she was out had
asked for herself.  The servant volunteered the
further information that she appeared to be in a
disorderly condition, and that, but for his
mistress's special interest in her, he would not have
admitted her to the house.
</p>

<p>
Constance went downstairs excited that the
wanderer had returned, yet reflecting that she had
chosen a most untimely date for her reappearance.
She said to herself that she would take a cab,
bundle Loretta off to Lincoln Chambers, and
conceal the fact of her presence in Benham from
Mrs. Wilson until the following day.  As she entered
the small reception-room, she was shocked by
Loretta's appearance.  She looked as though she had
lived ten years in one.  Her cheeks were sunken,
her eyes unnaturally bright, and her face wore
the aspect of degenerate dissipation.  She was
more conspicuously dressed than her circumstances
warranted, and her clothes appeared crumpled.
But her air was jaunty, and she met Constance's
solicitous greeting with an appalling gaiety.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm back again.  I hear you've been
hunting for me.  I suppose you'll want to know all
about it, so I might as well tell you my money's
gone.  Some of it I lent to my friend&mdash;him I
went back to&mdash;and the rest is spent.  We've been
in Chicago and New York, and&mdash;and I've had
the time of my life."
</p>

<p>
She evidently hoped to shock Constance by this
bravado; but distressed as the latter was by the
painful levity, she took for granted that Loretta
was not herself, and that though her speech was
fluent she was under the influence of some
stimulant, presumably the drug which Dr. Dale had
specified.  While she was wondering how to deal
with the situation and what could be the object of
Loretta's visit, the latter supplied the solution to
her second quandary.
</p>

<p>
"I've seen all about the big party she's giving
to-night.  That's why I've come."  She paused a
moment, then continued in a cunning whisper, as
though she were afraid of unfriendly ears: "I
want to get a chance to see it&mdash;the folk, I mean,
and the smart dresses.  Lord sake," she added,
noticing doubtless the consternation in her hearer's
face, "I do believe you thought I was asking to
come as one of the four hundred myself.  Thanks,
but I've left my new ball dress at home.  They
can tuck me in somewhere behind a curtain; I'd
be quiet; or I'd dress as a maid.  Manage it for
me, Constance, like a decent woman."  Her voice
cracked a little, and her eyes filled with tears,
suggesting a tipsy person.  Then suddenly her
manner changed; she squared her shoulders and said
malevolently, "I'm going to see it anyway.  It's
a small thing to ask of her who helped to kill my
only child."
</p>

<p>
It was a small thing to ask certainly, absurd as
the request seemed.  Constance reflected that,
inopportune as the application was, the decision, as
Loretta had intimated, did not rest with her.
</p>

<p>
"I will ask Mrs. Wilson, Loretta," she said, to
gain time to think.  "She will be home before
long."
</p>

<p>
At that moment the lady named entered the
room.  The butler had told her who her visitor
was, and she had not avoided the interview.  She
had just come from an afternoon tea given in
honor of the visiting pilgrims, and was attired in
her most elegant costume.  Loretta's eyes, as they
took in the exquisite details of her appearance,
dilated with the interest of fascination, yet their
gleam was envious rather than friendly.  Beholding
the two women face to face, Constance, struck
by the contrast, realized that they represented the
two poles of the social system; that the one
embodied aspiration, the graces of Christian
civilization and glittering success, the other
self-indulgence, moral decay, and hideous failure.  Such
were the prizes of deference to, and the penalties
of revolt against, the mandates of society!  Yet
even as she thus reasoned her heart was wrung
with intense pity, and it was she who offered
herself as a spokesman and laid Loretta's petition
before Mrs. Wilson.  That lady's face was a study
during the brief recital.  Bewilderment, horrified
repugnance, toleration, and finally hesitating
acquiescence succeeded one another as she listened to
the strange request and to her secretary's willingness
to take charge of her discreditable ward if
the permission to remain were granted.  Obnoxious
as the idea of having such a person in the house
at this time of all others appeared to her at first
blush, Mrs. Wilson's philanthropic instincts
speedily responded to the demand upon them in spite
of its obvious and vulgar sensationalism.  She,
like Constance, found herself asking why she need
refuse such a small favor to this unfortunate
creature merely because the supplication was so
distasteful to her.  If Constance were ready to
see that she did not make a spectacle of herself,
and would keep an eye on her, why, after all,
should she not remain?  Might not the sight of
the brilliant, refined spectacle even serve to
reinspire her with respect for the decencies of life?
Mrs. Wilson's imagination snatched at the hope.
Consent could not possibly do harm to anyone, and
it might be a means of reclaiming this erring
creature.
</p>

<p>
Constance perceived how her employer's mind
was working, and she made the course of
acquiescence smooth by saying:
</p>

<p>
"We will sit together, Mrs. Wilson, where we
can see and no one can see us.  And in return for
your consideration," she added meaningly, "Loretta
agrees to conduct herself as a lady&mdash;in such
a manner as not to offend anyone by her behavior
so long as she is in this house."
</p>

<p>
"Very well," said Mrs. Wilson.  "I am very
glad to give my permission.  You know what
Constance means, Loretta?"
</p>

<p>
Loretta nodded feverishly.  "I shall be all
right," she said.  She understood that they
referred to her habits, and she was willing enough
to guarantee good behavior, for she knew that
she had the assurance of it in her own pocket&mdash;a
small hypodermic syringe, the use of which would
steady her nerves for the time being.  It was with
an exultant intention of enjoying herself to the
uttermost, and of fooling her hostess to the top
of her bent, that after Constance had shown her
to a room that she might put herself to rights,
Loretta jabbed herself with the needle again and
again in pursuit of forbidden transport.
</p>

<p>
An hour later when Loretta was asleep under
the eye of a maid, Constance found time to
consider how she could ascertain the result of the
ballot, the haunting suspense as to which had kept
her heart in her mouth all day.  She lay in wait
for the evening newspaper, but she ransacked its
columns in vain, as she had feared would be the
case.  Evidently the vote had been taken too late
for publication.  While she stood in the hall
trying to muster courage to call up one of the
newspaper offices on the telephone and ask the
question&mdash;which would assuredly be a piece of
impertinence on the part of an unimportant person
like herself&mdash;she heard the ring of the front door
bell.  When the butler answered it the commanding
figure of Mr. Carleton Howard appeared in
the vestibule and from the shadow of the staircase
she heard him say with jubilant distinctness,
"You will tell Mrs. Wilson, James, that the
progressive legacy tax bill was killed this afternoon
by a majority of three votes.  Reconsideration
was asked for and refused; consequently the
measure is dead for this session."
</p>

<p>
Constance experienced that sinking feeling
which a great and sudden disappointment is apt
to bring.  She had taken for granted that
Gordon would win; that he would get the better of
his opponents in the end, despite their endeavors,
and gain a glorious victory for humanity and
himself.  Instead he had been crushed by his enemies,
and was tasting the bitterness of defeat.  He would
bear it bravely, she did not question that, but how
depressing to see the cause in behalf of which all
his energies had been enlisted defeated by the
narrowest margin on the very verge of success.
</p>

<p>
She remained for some moments as though
rooted to the spot.  As poor Loretta had once
said, it is love which makes the world go round,
and the world had suddenly stopped for her.  She
ascended the stairs like one in a trance and closed
the door of her room.  What would her sympathy
profit him?  How would it help him to know that
her heart bled for him?  Such condolence would
be only tantalization.  What he desired was
herself&mdash;to possess and cherish in the soul and in
the flesh&mdash;as the partner of his joys and sorrows,
his helpmate and his companion.  From where
she sat she could behold herself in her mirror the
comely embodiment of a woman in her prime,
alive with energy and health.  He sighed to hold
her in his arms, and she would fain kiss away the
disappointment of his defeat.  Anything short of
this would be mockery for him&mdash;yes, for her.
They were natural mates, for they loved each
other with the enthusiasm of mature sympathy.
Yet they must go their ways apart, because the
Church forbade in the name of Christ for the
so-called common good.  How could it be for the
common good to resist nature, when she knew in
her heart that in obeying the law of her being she
would feel no sense of shame or blame?  On the
one side was the fiat of the Church, and on the
other the sanction of the people&mdash;of human society
struggling for light and liberty against
superstition and authority.  That was Gordon's claim;
yet he was no demagogue, no irreverent materialist.
What would her own father have said&mdash;the
country doctor whose sympathy with humanity
was so profound?  She felt sure that he would
have swept aside the Church's argument in such a
case as this as untenable.  What was it held her
back?  The taunt that in obeying the law of her
being she would be letting go her hold on the
highest spiritual life, that most precious ambition
of her soul, and forsaking the Christ whose
followers had comforted her and lifted her up.
</p>

<p>
As thus she mused she heard Loretta stirring.
She had arranged as a precaution that they should
occupy chambers which opened into each other,
and it behooved her now to pay attention to
her&mdash;to see that she was suitably attired and to
supervise her movements.  When they were dressed she
exhibited to her the large dining-room set with
little tables, and afforded her a peep at the guests
as they swept in.  Later Loretta and she looked
down from a small balcony filled with plants on
the splendid company assembling in the music-room.
Her charge was completely absorbed by
the pageant, asking at first eager questions, which
Constance answered with mechanical scrupulousness,
for to her in spite of the brilliant scene the
world seemed far away, and she still dwelt as in
a trance.  As soon as Loretta recognized Lucille,
who in the most stunning of Parisian gowns was
assisting her mother to receive, she became
nervously agitated, and after surveying her for a few
moments she nudged her companion and said,
"What did I tell you?  Hasn't her marriage
turned out all right, and isn't everybody at her
feet?  You might be down there with the rest of
them to-night, if you'd only taken my advice."
</p>

<p>
The words brought Constance back to her
immediate surroundings, but as she became aware
that Loretta was thrusting in her face the fact of
Lucille's triumphant presence, she realized that it
had already been a significant item in her nebulous
consciousness.  But she laid her hand gently on
the offender's arm and said, "Sh!  No matter
about that now.  Remember your promise."  Loretta
grunted.  She paid heed to the extent of
changing her tone to a whisper, but murmured by
way of having the last word, "It's unjust that you
shouldn't be there; it's unjust."  Then she became
silent; but every little while during the evening
she repeated under her breath the same phrase, as
though it were a formula.
</p>

<p>
Constance remembered subsequently that as the
evening advanced Loretta ceased to ask questions
and grew strangely silent, seeming to follow with
her eyes every movement of Mrs. Wilson, who in
a costume of maroon-colored velvet set off by
superb jewels and a tiara of large diamonds, swept
with easy grace hither and thither in her endeavor
as hostess to make the blending between the
pilgrims and Benham's social leaders an agreeable
experience for all.
</p>

<p>
It was in truth a notable entertainment; the
guests appeared pleased and appreciative; there
were no hitches; the music evoked enthusiasm,
the supper was delicious, and the closing
distribution of trinkets by Benham's fairest
daughters came as a delightful surprise to the departing
seekers after truth.  But all save the consciousness
that she was facing a gay scene and was fulfilling
her responsibilities was lost on Constance.
She did not know until the next day that the
entertainment had been a great success, for, oblivious
to the music, the lights, and the brilliantly dressed
assembly, her soul was wrestling once more with
the problem which she had supposed solved
forever.  It was nearly one o'clock when the murmur
of voices died away, and she conducted Loretta
to their mutual apartment.  She was glad that her
charge showed no disposition to talk over the
events of the evening, but on the contrary
undressed in silence, busy with her own reflections.
Having seen her safely in bed, Constance straightway
sat down at her desk and wrote.  It was a
short, hasty note, for she was bent on posting it
that night before the lights in the house were
extinguished.  Throwing a cloak about her, she
glided downstairs, and, with a word of warning
to the butler that he might not lock her out,
sought the letter-box which was less than a
hundred yards distant.  She had not chosen to trust
her epistle to any other hands.  As she lifted the
iron shutter she paused for a moment, then with
a joyful little sigh she dropped it in and let go.
Fifteen minutes later, like a happy, tired child,
and wondering what the morrow would bring, she
escaped from reality into the waiting arms of
sleep.
</p>

<p>
But Mrs. Randolph Wilson was in no haste to
go to bed.  She was in a complacent mood.
Everything had gone off as she intended, and it
suited her to dwell in retrospect on the incidents
of the festivity, and to muse fancy free.  Lucille
had kissed her good-night and had retired.  She
had let her maid loosen her dress and had
dismissed her for the night.  She was inclined to
dally; she liked the silence and the sense of calm
after the activities of the day.
</p>

<p>
Seated at her toilet table and looking into her
mirror with her cheeks resting upon her hands,
she gazed introspectively at herself and destiny.
Her tiara of diamonds still crested her forehead.
Somehow it pleased her to leave it undisturbed
until she was ready to let down her hair.  She
was conscious that she had reached the age when
she preferred to see herself at her best rather than
in the garb of nature's disorder.  It had been one
of the eventful evenings of her life; she felt that
by her efforts mind and matter had been drawn
closer together without detriment to either.  And
everybody had been extremely civil to Lucille, at
which she could not help rejoicing.  Certainly,
too, Lucille was acquiring more social charm and
was more anxious to please people of cultivation.
Then, too, her brother had appeared in his most
engaging mood as a consequence of the defeat of
the legacy tax bill.  No reason for doubting her
conclusion that the passage of the measure would
have been premature under existing conditions
had occurred to her; so it seemed that society had
been saved from a mistake.  Altogether the
immediate present was marred by no unpleasant
memory but one.  As to that, she felt that she had
acted indulgently, and that on the morrow she
would make a last effort to rescue the unhappy
degenerate.  As she surveyed herself in the glass
she appreciated that she was well preserved and
that her grizzled hair was becoming, but that the
romance of life was over.  She would never marry
again; she was unequivocally middle-aged.  Ideas
were what she had left; but for this great interest
she had many years of strength and activity ahead
of her.
</p>

<p>
Ideas!  How absorbing they were, and yet how
little the most disinterested individual could
accomplish!  Truth looked so near, and yet ever
seemed to recede as one approached it.  Men and
women came and went, generations lived and died,
but progress, like the march of the glaciers, was
to be measured by the centuries.  The inequalities
of life&mdash;how hideous were they still; how far from
rectification, in spite of priests and charity!  What
was the key to the riddle?  Where was the open
sesame to the social truth which should be
universal beauty?  She was seeking it with all her
soul, but she would never find it.  Deep in the
womb of time it lay, a magnet, yet inscrutable.
Who would unearth it?  Would it baffle mankind
forever? or would centuries hence some
searcher&mdash;perhaps a woman like herself&mdash;discern and
reveal it?
</p>

<p>
Pensive with her speculation, she turned her
eyes, wistful with their yearning to pierce the
mysteries of time, full upon the mirror, and started.
An apparition, a woman's face, cunning, resentful,
demon-like, was there beside her own; a
woman's figure crouching, stealthy, about to
spring was stealing toward her.  Was it a vision,
an uncanny creature of the brain?  Instinctively
she turned, and as she did so a large pair of
hands gleamed in her face and reached for her
neck.  Springing up with a cry of horror, she
recoiled from the threatening fingers, but in another
instant she was bent backward so that her head
pressed against the glass and she felt a powerful
clutch upon her throat which took away the power
to scream, and made her eyes feel as though they
were bursting from their sockets.  A voice, exultant,
cruel, yet like a revivalist's chant, rang in
her ears.
</p>

<p>
"I've come for you.  We'll go together, down
to eternity.  There you will scrub dirty marble
floors for ever and ever."
</p>

<p>
In the face in the mirror Mrs. Wilson had
recognized Loretta, and she divined, as the wild
figure threw itself upon her and the strong
hands gripped her windpipe, that she was
contending with a mad-woman.  The import of the
strange, accusing words was unmistakable; it was
a struggle for life.  Powerless to give the alarm
save by inarticulate gasps, she realized that only
her own strength could avail her, and that this
must fail owing to the superior hold which her
assailant had established.  She strove with all her
might to wrench herself free, but in vain.  The
long hands squeezed like a vise, and she was
choking.  She felt her senses swim, and that she was
about to faint.  Then with a rush a third figure
intervened; someone else's hands were battling on
her side, and in an instant she was free.
</p>

<p>
Awaking suddenly, as one who is sleeping on
guard often will, Constance had felt an instinct
that something was wrong.  The turning on of
the electric light revealed that Loretta's bed was
empty.  Where had she gone?  It seemed improbable
that she had sought to escape from the
house at that hour.  Puzzled, she stepped into
the hall and half-way down the staircase.  There
as she paused the light shining from under
Mrs. Wilson's apartment on the landing below caught
her eye.  The next moment she heard a muffled
scream.
</p>

<p>
It had required all her strength and weight to
tear Loretta from her victim.  Having succeeded
in separating them, Constance hastily put herself
on the defensive, expecting a fresh attack; but
Loretta, panting from her exertions, stood facing
them for a moment, then burst into a strident,
gleeful laugh.
</p>

<p>
"You've saved her," she cried.  "I'm crazy&mdash;stark
crazy, I guess.  What was it I said?  I
was going to take her where she'd have to scrub
dirty marble floors forever and ever.  I'd like to
save her soul, she tried so hard to save mine.  But
it was time thrown away from the start.  I was
born bad&mdash;a moral pervert, as the doctors call it.
Christianity was wasted on me."
</p>

<p>
She shook her head, and looked from one
to the other.  They, horrified but spellbound,
waited, uncertain what course to pursue.  Mrs. Wilson,
now that she had partially recovered her
poise, felt the impulse to elucidate this horrifying
mystery.  But though she wished to speak, the
proper language did not suggest itself.  How
could one discuss causes with a mad woman?  She
raised her hands to put in place the tiara which
had been crushed down on her brow.
</p>

<p>
"Look at her," cried Loretta, commandingly,
addressing Constance and pointing.  "Isn't she
beautiful?  She's civilization."  She made a low
obeisance.  "I was in love with her once; I love
her still.  You saved her."
</p>

<p>
She frowned and passed her hand across her
forehead as though to clear her brain.  Then she
laughed again; she had recovered her clew.
</p>

<p>
"You were the sort she could help, Constance
Stuart; you were good.  But how has she&mdash;her
church&mdash;paid you back?  Cheated you with a
gold brick.  Ha!  Made you believe that it was
your Christian duty to let Gordon Perry, Esq.,
Counsellor-at-Law, go.  That's the way the
aristocrats still try to fool the common people.  But
isn't she beautiful?  My compliments to both of
you."
</p>

<p>
She swept a low courtesy in exaggeration of
those she had witnessed a few hours earlier.  "It
is pitiful&mdash;pitiful and perplexing," murmured
Mrs. Wilson in agonized dismay.
</p>

<p>
For a moment Loretta stood irresolute, then
of a sudden she began to shiver like one seized
with an ague.  She regarded them distractedly
with staring eyes, and throwing up her hands, fell
forward on her face in convulsive delirium.
Constance rushed to her side; the two women raised
her and laid her on the bed.  Mrs. Wilson's maid
was aroused, and a physician communicated with
by telephone.  He came within an hour and
prescribed the necessary treatment.  He said that the
patient's system was saturated with cocaine, but
intimated that she would probably recover from
this attack.
</p>

<p>
After the doctor had gone and Loretta had
been removed to her own room, Mrs. Wilson and
Constance watched by the side of the sufferer,
whose low moaning was the sole disturber of the
stillness of the breaking dawn.  Each was lost in
her own secret thoughts.  The cruel finger-marks
on Mrs. Wilson's neck burned painfully, but the
words of her mad critic had seared her soul.  For
the moment social truth seemed sadly remote.  She
reflected mournfully but humbly that ever and
anon proud man and his systems are held up to
derision by the silent forces of nature.  When the
darkness had faded so that they could discern each
other's faces, she arose, and sitting down beside
Constance on the sofa drew her toward her and
kissed her.  Was it in acknowledgment that she
had saved her life, or as a symbol of a broader
faith?
</p>

<p>
"Kiss me too, Constance," she whispered.
</p>

<p>
The embrace was fondly returned, and at this
loosening of the tension of their strained spirits
they wept gently in each other's arms.  Then
Mrs. Wilson added, "Come, let us go where we can
talk.  We could do nothing at present which my
maid cannot do."
</p>

<p>
She led the way to her boudoir.  The idea of
seeking sleep had never occurred to either of them.
Although Mrs. Wilson had felt the need of
speech, it was some minutes after they had
established themselves before she broke the silence.
When she did so she spoke suddenly and with
emotion, like one beset by a repugnant conviction
yet loath to acknowledge it.
</p>

<p>
"Can I have deserved this, Constance?"  The
vivid protest in her companion's face made clear
that Constance did not penetrate her subtler
meaning, and she hastened to answer her own
question.
</p>

<p>
"Not to be strangled by a violent lunatic," she
said, raising a hand involuntarily to her neck.
"But her words were a judgment&mdash;a lacerating
judgment.  How I should loathe it&mdash;to scrub
dirty marble floors forever and ever.  It is just
that&mdash;the dirt, the disorder, the common reek,
which I shrink from and shun in spite of myself.
How did she ever find out?  I love too much the
lusciousness of life.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'It is the little rift within the lute<br />
  That by and by will make the music mute,<br />
  And ever widening slowly silence all.'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Do you not see, Constance?"
</p>

<p>
Leaning forward with clasped hands and
speaking with melodious pathos while the morning
light rested on her tired but interesting face,
her confession had the effect of a monologue save
for its final question.  And Constance, listening
understood.  In truth, this cry of the soul at bay
came as a quickener to her own surging emotions,
and she realized that the walls of the temple of
beauty had fallen like those of Jericho at the
trumpets of Israel.  Yet though she understood
and saw starkly revealed the limit of the gospel
of the splendor of things, with all the purging of
perplexities which that meant for her, the claims
of gratitude and of unabated admiration no less
than pity caused her to shrink from immediate
acquiescence in her patron's self-censure.  And as
she hesitated for the proper antidote, Mrs. Wilson
pursued her confession relentlessly&mdash;pursued
it, however, as one who recites the weakness of a
cause to which she is hopelessly committed.
</p>

<p>
"One is spurred to refine and refine and refine,&mdash;does
not even religion&mdash;my religion&mdash;so teach
us?&mdash;the spirit ostensibly, and, in order to reach
the spirit, the body; and in this age of things and
of great possessions one reaches greedily after the
quintessence of comfort until&mdash;until one needs
some shock like this to perceive that one might
become&mdash;perhaps is, an intellectual sybarite.  Nay,
more; though we crave almost by instinct individual
lustre and personal safety, reaching out for
luxury that we may grow superfine, must not
we&mdash;we American women with ideals&mdash;mistrust the
social beauty of a universe which still produces
the masses and all the horrors of life?  Can it
fundamentally avail that a few should be exquisite
and have radiant thoughts, if the rest are
condemned to a coarse, unlovely heritage?"
</p>

<p>
Not only did gratitude reassert itself as Constance
listened to this speculative plaint, but protesting
common sense as well, which recognized
the morbidness of the thought without ignoring its
cogency.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, you exaggerate; you are unjust to yourself,"
she exclaimed fervidly.  "You must not
overlook what your influence and example have
been to me and many others.  I owe you so much! more
than I can ever repay.  It was you who
opened the garden of life to me."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson started at the tense, spontaneous
apostrophe, and the color mounted to her cheeks.
Never had so grateful a tribute been laid at her
feet as this in the hour of tribulation.  And as she
gazed she felt that she had a right to be proud of
the noble-looking, the sophisticated woman who
held out to her these refreshing laurels.
</p>

<p>
"And it is not that I do not comprehend&mdash;that
I do not share your qualms," Constance continued,
ignoring the gracious look that she might express
herself completely in this crucial hour.  The time
had come to utter her own secret, which she felt
to be the most eloquent of revolts against the
mystic superfineness she had just heard deprecated.
"Within the last twelve hours the scales have
fallen from my eyes also, and what seemed to
me truth is no longer truth.  There is something
I wish to tell you, Mrs. Wilson.  Yesterday
afternoon I heard that the legacy tax bill had been
defeated; last night before I went to bed I posted
a letter to Gordon Perry informing him that I
would be his wife.  I have asked him to come to
see me at Lincoln Chambers this morning."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson's lip trembled.  Genuine as was
her probing of self, this flank attack from one who
just now had brought balm to her wounds and
cheer to her soul was a fresh and vivid shock.  To
feel that this other ward, whom she had deemed
so safe, was about to slip from her fingers was
more than she could bear.  Then instinctively
Constance went to her and put her arm around
her.  "I am sorry to hurt you," she said tenderly,
"but this is a time to speak plainly.  I love him,
and I feel that I have been trifling with love.  I
am sure at last of this: that it is better for the
world that two people like him and me should be
happy than live apart out of deference to a bond
which is a mere husk.  I prefer to be natural and
free rather than exquisite and artificial.  As
Gordon said, the ban of the Church when the law gives
one freedom is nothing but a fetich.  I cannot
follow the Church in this.  To do so would be to
starve my soul for the sake of a false ideal&mdash;a false
beauty cultivated for the few alone, as you have
intimated, at the expense of the great heart of
humanity.  I can no longer be a party to such an
injustice; I must not sacrifice to it the man I
love."
</p>

<p>
There was a brief silence.  Mrs. Wilson, as her
question presently showed, was trying to piece
together cause and effect.
</p>

<p>
"You wrote to him last night, Constance?
Then this&mdash;horror had nothing to do with your
decision?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing; I had been on the verge of it for
some time: I can see that now.  And when the
news of his defeat came, I felt that I must go to
him if he would let me."
</p>

<p>
"He will let you, Constance."
</p>

<p>
"I think so," she answered with a happy thrill.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson looked up at her, and observing
the serenity of her countenance, knew that the
issue was settled beyond peradventure.  Yet she
was in the mood to be generous as well as humble;
moreover, her inquiring mind had not failed
to notice the plea for humanity and to feel its
force.  She sighed gently, then patted the hand
that held hers, and said:
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps, dear, you are right.  At all events,
go now and get some sleep.  You must look your
own sweet self when he comes to you."
</p>

<p>
A few hours later Constance, refreshed by
slumber, was on her way to Lincoln Chambers.
She walked as though on wings, for she knew in
her heart that her lover would not fail her.
Arriving a little before the appointed time, she
dismissed the children to school, and, smiling at fate,
waited for what was to be.  At the stroke of the
trysting hour she heard his knock.  She bade him
enter, and as their eyes met he folded her in his
arms.
</p>

<p>
"Gordon!"
</p>

<p>
"Constance!"
</p>

<p>
"I have surrendered."  She looked up into his
face, bewitching in her happiness.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-472"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-472.jpg" alt="&quot;I have surrendered.&quot;" />
<br />
&quot;I have surrendered.&quot;
</p>

<p>
"Thank God for that!"
</p>

<p>
"But I come to you conscience free, Gordon,"
she said, drawing back her radiant face so that
he must hear her avowal before his title was
complete.  "I would not have you think that I have
compromised or juggled with myself.  If I
believed that I should be a whit less pure and
spiritual a woman by becoming your wife, I would
never have sent for you, dearly as I love you."
</p>

<p>
"And I would not have had you, darling.  The
love which is conscious of a stain is a menace to
the world."
</p>

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
